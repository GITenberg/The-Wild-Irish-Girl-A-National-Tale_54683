      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f there are
      certain circumstances under which a fond father can address an imprisoned
      son without suffering the bitterest heart-rendings of paternal agony, such
      are not those under which I now address you. To sustain the loss of the
      most precious of all human rights, and forfeit our liberty at the shrine
      of virtue, in defence of our country abroad, or of our public integrity
      and principles at home, brings to the heart of the sufferer&rsquo;s dearest
      sympathising friend a soothing solace, almost concomitant to the poignancy
      of his afflictions; and leaves the decision difficult, whether in the
      scale of human feelings, triumphant pride or affectionate regret
      preponderate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; said the old earl of Ormond, &ldquo;give up my dead son for
      twenty living ones.&rdquo; Oh! how I envy such a father the possession, and even
      the <i>loss</i> of such a child: with what eagerness my heart rushes back
      to that period when <i>I</i> too triumphed in my son; when I beheld him
      glowing in all the unadulterated virtues of the happiest nature, flushed
      with the proud consciousness of superior genius, refined by a taste
      intuitively elegant, and warmed by an enthusiasm constitutionally ardent;
      his character indeed tinctured with the bright colouring of romantic
      eccentricity, but marked by the indelible traces of innate rectitude, and
      ennobled by the purest principles of native generosity, the proudest sense
      of inviolable honour, I beheld him rush eagerly on life, enamoured of its
      seeming good, incredulous of its latent evils, till fatally fascinated by
      the magic spell of the former, he fell an early victim to the successful
      lures of the latter. The growing influence of his passions kept pace with
      the expansion of his mind, and the moral powers of the <i>man of genius</i>,
      gave way to the overwhelming propensities of the <i>man of pleasure</i>.
      Yet in the midst of those exotic vices (for as such even yet I would
      consider them,) he continued at once the object of my parental partiality
      and anxious solicitude; I admired while I condemned, I pitied while I
      reproved.

    </p>
    <p>
      The rights of primogeniture, and the mild and prudent cast of your
      brother&rsquo;s character, left me no cares either for his worldly interest or
      moral welfare: born to titled affluence, his destination in life was
      ascertained previous to his entrance on its chequered scene; and equally
      free from passions to mislead, or talents to stimulate, he promised to his
      father that series of temperate satisfaction which, unillumined by those
      coruscations, <i>your</i> superior and promising genius flashed on the
      parental heart, could not prepare for its sanguine feelings that mortal
      disappointment with which <i>you</i> have destroyed all its hopes. On the
      recent death of my father I found myself possessed of a very large but
      incumbered property: it was requisite I should make the same establishment
      for my eldest son, that my father had made for me; while I was conscious
      that my youngest was in some degree to stand indebted to his own
      exertions, for independence as well as elevation in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may recollect that during your first college vacation, we conversed on
      the subject of that liberal profession I had chosen for you, and you
      agreed with me, that it was congenial to your powers, and not inimical to
      your taste; while the part I was anxious you should take in the
      legislation of your country, seemed at once to rouse and gratify your
      ambition; but the pure flame of laudable emulation was soon extinguished
      in the destructive atmosphere of pleasure, and while I beheld you, in the
      visionary hopes of my parental ambition, invested with the crimson robe of
      legal dignity, or shining brightly conspicuous in the splendid galaxy of
      senatorial luminaries, <i>you</i> were idly presiding as the high priest
      of libertinism at the nocturnal orgies of vitiated dissipation, or
      indolently lingering out your life in elegant but unprofitable pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It were as vain as impossible to trace you through every degree of error
      on the scale of folly and imprudence, and such a repetition would be more
      heart wounding to me than painful to you, were it even made under the most
      extenuating bias of parental fondness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have only to add, that though already greatly distressed by the
      liquidation of your debts, at a time when I am singularly circumstanced
      with respect to pecuniary resources, I will make a struggle to free you
      from the chains of this your present <i>iron</i>-hearted creditor, through
      the retrenchment of my <i>own</i> expenses, and my temporary retreat to
      the solitute of my Irish estate must be the result; provided that by this
      sacrifice I purchace your acquiescence to my wishes respecting the destiny
      of your future life, and an unreserved abjuration of the follies which
      have governed your past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <h3>
      M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO THE EARL OF M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffer me, in the fullness of my heart, and in the language of one
      prodigal and penitent as myself, to say, &ldquo;I have sinned against Heaven and
      thee, and am no longer worthy to be called thy son.&rdquo; Abandon me then, I
      beseech you, as such; deliver me up to the destiny, that involves me to
      the complicated tissue of errors and follies I have so industriously woven
      with my own hands; for though I am equal to sustain the judgment my own
      vices have drawn down upon me, I cannot support the cruel mercy with which
      your goodness endeavours to avert its weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the numerous catalogues of my faults, a sordid selfishness finds no
      place. Yet I should deservedly incur its imputation, were I to accept of
      freedom on such terms as you are so generous to offer. No, my Lord,
      continue to adorn that high and polished circle in which you are so
      eminently calculated to move; nor think so lowly of one, who, with all his
      faults, is <i>your son</i>, as to believe him ready to purchase <i>his</i>
      liberty at the expense of <i>your</i> banishment from your native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am, &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>King&rsquo;s Bench</i>. H. M.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO THE HON. HORATIO M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>n act to which the
      exaggeration of <i>your</i> feelings gives the epithet of banishment, I
      shall consider as a voluntary sequestration from scenes of which I am
      weary, to scenes which, though thrice visited, still preserve the poignant
      charms of novelty and interest. Your hasty and undigested answer to my
      letter (written in the prompt emotion of the moment, ere the probable
      consequence of a romantic rejection to an offer not unreflectingly made,
      could be duly weighed or coolly examined) convinces me experience has
      contributed little to the modification of your feelings, or the prudent
      regulation of your conduct. It is this promptitude of feeling, this
      contempt of prudence, that formed the predisposing cause of your errors
      and your follies. Dazzled by the brilliant glare of the splendid virtues,
      you saw not, you would not see, that prudence was among the first of moral
      excellences; the director, the regulator, the standard of them all; that
      it is in fact the corrector of virtue herself; for even <i>virtue</i>,
      like the <i>sun</i>, has her <i>solstice</i>, beyond which she ought not
      to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would retribute what you seem to lament, and unite restitution to
      penitence, leave this country for a short time, and abandon with the
      haunts of your former blameable pursuits, those associates who were at
      once the cause and punishment of your errors. I myself will become your
      partner in exile, for it is to my estate in Ireland I <i>banish</i> you
      for the summer. You have already got through the &ldquo;first rough brakes&rdquo; of
      your profession: as you can now serve the last term of this season, I see
      no cause why <i>Coke upon Lyttleton</i> cannot be as well studied amidst
      the wild seclusion of Connaught scenery, and on the solitary shores of the
      &ldquo;steep Atlantic,&rdquo; as in the busy bustling precincts of the Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have only to add, that I shall expect your undivided attention will be
      given up to your professional studies; that you will for a short interval
      resign the fascinating pursuits of polite literature and belles lettres,
      from which even the syren spell of pleasure could not tear you, and which
      snatched from vice many of those hours I believed devoted to more serious
      studies. I know you will find it no less difficult to resign the elegant
      theories of your favourite <i>Lavater</i>, for the dry facts of law
      reports, than to exchange your duodecimo editions of the amatory poets,
      for heavy tomes of cold legal disquisitions; but happiness is to be
      purchased, and labour is the price; fame and independence are the result
      of talent united to great exertion, and the elegant enjoyments of literary
      leisure are never so keenly relished as when tasted under the shade of
      that flourishing laurel which our own efforts have reared to mature
      perfection. Farewell! My agent has orders respecting the arrangement of
      your affairs. You must excuse the procrastination of our interview till we
      meet in Ireland, which I fear will not be so immediate as my wishes would
      incline. I shall write to my banker in Dublin to replenish your purse on
      your arrival in Ireland, and to my Connaught steward, to prepare for your
      reception at M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house. Write to me by return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more farewell!
    </p>

      M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.

      TO THE EARL OF M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      My Lord,
    </p>
    <p>
      He who agonized on the bed of Procrostus reposed on a couch of down,
      compared to the sufferings of him who in the heart he has stabbed, beholds
      the pulse of generous affection still beating with an invariable throb for
      the being who has inflicted the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall offer you no thanks, my Lord, for the generosity of your conduct,
      nor any extenuation for the errors of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gratitude the one has given birth to&mdash;the remorse which the other
      has awakened, bid equal defiance to expression. I have only (fearfully) to
      hope, that you will not deny my almost forfeited claim to the title of
      your son.

      <i>Holyhead.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e are told in the
      splendid Apocrypha of ancient Irish fable, that when one of the learned
      was missing on the Continent of Europe, it was proverbially said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Amandatus est ad disciplinum in Hibernia</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I cannot recollect that in its fabulous or veracious history, Ireland
      was ever the mart of voluntary exile to the man of pleasure; so that when
      you and the rest of my precious associates miss the track of my footsteps
      in the oft trod path of dissipation, you will never think of tracing its
      pressure to the wildest of the Irish shores, and exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Amandatus
      est ad, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, I am so far advanced in the land of <i>Druidism</i>, on my way to
      the &ldquo;Island of Saints,&rdquo; while you, in the emporium of the world, are
      drinking from the cup of conjugal love a temporary oblivion to your past
      sins and wickedness, and revelling in the first golden dreams of
      matrimonial illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose an account of my high crimes and misdemeanours, banishment,
      &amp;c. &amp;c. have already reached your ears; but while my brethren in
      transportation are offering up their wishes and their hopes on the shore,
      to the unpropitious god of winds, indulge me in the garrulity of egotism,
      and suffer me to correct the overcharged picture of that arch charicature
      <i>report</i>, by giving you a correct <i>ebauche</i> of the recent
      circumstances of my useless life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I gave you convoy as far as Dover, on your way to France, I returned
      to London, to
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Surfeit on the same
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      and yawn my joys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And was again soon plunged in that dreadful vacillation of mind from which
      your society and conversation had so lately redeemed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vibrating between an innate propensity to <i>rights</i> and an habitual
      adherence to <i>wrong</i>; sick of pursuits I was too indolent to
      relinqush, and linked to vice, yet still enamoured of virtue; weary of the
      useless, joyless inanity of my existence, yet without energy, without
      power to regenerate my worthless being; daily losing ground in the minds
      of the inestimable few who were still interested for my welfare; nor
      compensating for the loss, by the gratification of any one feeling in my
      own heart, and held up as an object of fashionable popularity for
      sustaining that character, which of all others I most despised; my taste
      impoverished by a vicious indulgence, my senses palled by repletion, my
      heart chill and unawakened, every appetite depraved and pampered into
      satiety, I fled from myself, as the object of my own utter contempt and
      detestation, and found a transient pleasurable inebriety in the well
      practised blandishments of Lady C&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      You who alone know me, who alone have <i>openly</i> condemned, and <i>secretly</i>
      esteemed me, you who have wisely culled the blossom of pleasure, while I
      have sucked its poison, know that I am rather a <i>méchant par air</i>,
      than from any irresistible propensity to indiscriminate libertinism. In
      fact, the <i>original sin</i> of my nature militates against the hackneyed
      modes of hackneyed licentiousness; for I am too profound a voluptuary to
      feel any exquisite gratification from such gross pursuits as the &ldquo;<i>swinish
      multitude</i>&rdquo; of fashion ennoble with that name of little understood, <i>pleasure</i>.
      Misled in my earliest youth by &ldquo;passion&rsquo;s meteor ray,&rdquo; even then my heart
      called (but called in vain,) for a thousand delicious refinements to give
      poignancy to the mere transient impulse of sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! my dear friend, if in that sunny season of existence when the ardours
      of youth nourish in our bosom a thousand indescribable emotions of
      tenderness and love, it had been <i>my</i> fortunate destiny to have met
      with a being, who&mdash;but this is an idle regret, perhaps an idle
      supposition;&mdash;-the moment of ardent susceptibility is over, when
      woman becomes the sole spell which lures us to good or ill, and when her
      omnipotence, according to the bias of her own nature, and the organization
      of those feelings on which it operates, determines, in a certain degree
      our destiny through life&mdash;leads the mind through the medium of the
      heart to the noblest pursuits, or seduces it through the medium of the
      passions to the basest career.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I became the dupe of Lady C&mdash;&mdash;, and her artful
      predecessor, arose from the want of that &ldquo;something still unpossessed,&rdquo; to
      fill my life&rsquo;s dreadful void. I sensibly felt the want of an object to
      interest my feelings, and laboured under that dreadful interregnum of the
      heart, reason and ambition; which leaves the craving passions open to
      every invader. Lady C&mdash;&mdash; perceived the situation of my mind,
      and&mdash;but spare me the detail of a connexion which even in memory,
      produces a <i>nausea</i> of every sense and feeling. Suffice it to say,
      that equally the victim of the husband&rsquo;s villainy as the wife&rsquo;s artifice,
      I stifled on its birth a threatened prosecution, by giving my bond for a
      sum I was unable to liquidate: it was given as for a gambling debt, but my
      father, who had long suspected, and endeavoured to break this fatal
      connexion, guessed at the truth, and suffered me to become a guest (<i>mal
      voluntaire</i>) in the King&rsquo;s Bench. This unusual severity on his part,
      lessened not on mine the sense of his indulgence to my former boundless
      extravagance, and I determined to remain a prisoner for life, rather than
      owe my liberty to a new imposition on his tenderness, by such solicitings
      as have hitherto been invariably crowned with success, though answered
      with reprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been already six weeks a prisoner, deserted by those gay moths that
      had fluttered round the beam of my transient prosperity; delivered up to
      all the maddening meditation of remorse, when I received a letter from my
      father (then with my brother in Leicestershire,) couched in his usual
      terms of reprehension, and intervals of tenderness; ascertaining every
      error with judicial exactitude, and associating every fault with some
      ideal excellence of parental creation, alternately the father and the
      judge; and as you once said, when I accused him of partiality to his
      eldest born, &ldquo;talking <i>best</i> of Edward was <i>most</i> of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a word, he has behaved like an Angel. So well, that by Heavens! I can
      scarcely bear to think of it. A spurious half-bred generosity&mdash;a
      little tincture of illiberality on his side, would have been Balm of
      Gillead to my wounded conscience; but with unqualified goodness he has
      paid all my debts, supplied my purse beyond my wants, and only asks in
      return, that I will retire for a few months to Ireland, and this I believe
      merely to wean me from the presence of an object which he falsely believes
      still hangs about my heart with no moderate influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I wish his mercy had flowed in any other channel, even though more
      confined and less liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he banished me to the savage desolations of Siberia, my exile would
      have had some character; had he even transported me to a South Sea Island,
      or threw me into an Esquimaux hut, my new species of being would have been
      touched with some interest; for in fact, the present relaxed state of my
      intellectual system requires some strong transition of place,
      circumstance, and manners, to wind it up to its native tone, to rouse it
      to energy, or awaken it to exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sent to a country against which I have a decided prejudice&mdash;which
      I suppose semi-barbarous, semi-civilized; has lost the strong and hardy
      features of savage life, without acquiring those graces which distinguish
      polished society&mdash;I shall neither participate in the poignant
      pleasure of awakened curiosity and acquired information, nor taste the
      least of those enjoyments which courted my acceptance in my native land.
      Enjoyments did I say! And were they indeed enjoyments? How readily the
      mind adopts the phraseology of habit, when the sentiment it once clothed
      no longer exists. Would that my past pursuits were even in <i>recollection</i>,
      the aspect of enjoyments. But even my memory has lost its character of
      energy, and the past, like the present, appears one unwearied scence of
      chill and vapid existence. No sweet point of reflection seizes on the
      recollective powers. No actual joy woos my heart&rsquo;s participation, and no
      prospect of future felicity glows on the distant vista of life, or awakens
      the quick throb of hope and expectation; all is cold, sullen and dreary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Laval</i> seems to entertain no less prejudice against this country
      than his master, he has therefore begged leave of absence until my father
      comes over. Pray have the goodness to send me by him a box of Italian
      crayons, and a good thermometer; for I must have something to relieve the
      <i>tedium vitae</i> of my exiled days; and in my articles of stipulation
      with my father, chemistry and belles lettres are <i>specially</i>
      prohibited. It was a useless prohibition, for Heaven knows, chemistry
      would have been the last study I should have flown to in my present state
      of mind. For how can he look minutely into the intimate structure of
      things, and resolve them into their simple and elementary substance, whose
      own disordered mind is incapable of analyzing the passions by which it is
      agitated, of ascertaining the reciprocal relation of its incoherent ideas,
      or combining them in different proportions (from those by which they were
      united by chance,) in order to join a new and useful compound for the
      benefit of future life? As for belles lettres! so blunted are all those
      powers once so

      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Dublin, March</i>, &mdash;&mdash;, 17&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> remember, when I
      was a boy, meeting somewhere with the quaintly written travels of <i>Moryson</i>
      through Ireland, and being particularly struck with his assertion, that so
      late as the days of Elizabeth, an Irish chieftain and his family were
      frequently seen seated round their domestic fire in a state of perfect
      nudity. This singular anecdote (so illustrative of the barbarity of the
      Irish, at a period when civilization had made such a wonderful progress
      even in its sister countries,) fastened so strongly on my boyish
      imagination, that whenever the <i>Irish</i> were mentioned in my presence,
      an <i>Esquimaux</i> group circling round the fire which was to dress a
      dinner, or broil an enemy, was the image which presented itself to my
      mind; and in this trivial source, I believe, originated that early formed
      opinion of Irish ferocity, which has since been nurtured into a <i>confirmed
      prejudice</i>. So true it is, that almost all the erroneous principles
      which influence our maturer being, are to be traced to some fatal
      association of ideas received and formed in early life. But whatever maybe
      the <i>cause</i>, I feel the strongest objection to becoming a resident in
      the remote part of a country which is still shaken by the convulsions of
      an anarchical spirit; where for a series of ages the olive of peace has
      not been suffered to shoot forth <i>one</i> sweet blossom of national
      concord, which the sword of civil dissension has not cropt almost in the
      germ; and the natural character of whose factious sons, as we are still
      taught to believe, is turbulent, faithless, intemperate, and cruel;
      formerly destitute of arts, letters, or civilization, and still but slowly
      submitting to their salutary and ennobling influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confess the truth, I had so far suffered prejudice to get the start of
      unbiassed liberality, that I had almost assigned to these rude people
      scenes appropriately barbarous; and never was more pleasantly astonished,
      than when the morning&rsquo;s dawn gave to my view one of the most splendid
      spectacles in the scene of picturesque creation I had ever beheld, or
      indeed ever conceived&mdash;the bay of Dublin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A foreigner on board the packet compared the view to that which the bay of
      Naples affords: I cannot judge of the justness of the comparison, though I
      am told one very general and commonplace; but if the scenic beauties of
      the Irish bay are exceeded by those of the Neapolitan, my fancy falls
      short in a just conception of its charms. The springing up of a contrary
      wind kept us for a considerable time beating about this enchanting coast;
      the weather suddenly changed, the rain poured in torrents, a storm arose,
      and the beautiful prospect which had fascinated our gaze, vanished in the
      mists of impenetrable obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we had the mail on board, a boat was sent out to receive it, the oars
      of which were plied by six men, whose statures, limbs, and features
      declared them the lingering progeny of the once formidable race of Irish
      giants, Bare headed, they &ldquo;bided the pelting of the pitiless storm,&rdquo; with
      no other barrier to its fury, than what tattered check trousers, and
      shirts open at neck, and tucked above the elbows afforded; and which thus
      disposed, betrayed the sinewy contexture of forms, which might have
      individually afforded a model to sculpture, for the colossal statue of an
      Hercules, under all the different aspects of strength and exertion. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This little marine sketch is by no means a fancy picture;
     it was actually copied from the life, in the summer of 1806.
</pre>
    <p>
      A few of the passengers proposing to venture in the boat, I listlessly
      followed, and found myself seated by one of these sea monsters, who, in an
      accent that made me startle, addressed me in English at least as pure and
      correct as a Thames&rsquo; boatman would use; and with so much courtesy,
      cheerfulness, and respect, that I was at a loss to reconcile such
      civilization of manner to such ferocity of appearance; while his
      companions as they stemmed the mountainous waves, or plied their heavy
      oars, displayed such a vein of low humour and quaint drollery, and in a
      language so curiously expressive and original, that no longer able to
      suppress my surprise, I betrayed it to a gentleman who sat near me, and by
      whom I was assured that this species of colloquial wit was peculiar to the
      lower class of the Irish, who borrowed much of their curious phraseology
      from the peculiar idiom of their own tongue, and the cheeriness of manner
      from the native exility of their temperament; &ldquo;and as for their
      courteousness.&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you will find them on a further
      intercourse, civil even to <i>adulation</i>, as long as you treat them
      with apparent kindness, but an opposite conduct will prove their manner
      proportionably uncivilized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very excusable,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are of a class in society to which
      the modification of the feelings are unknown, and to be sensibly alive to
      <i>kindness or to unkindness</i>, is, in my opinion, a noble trait in the
      national character of an unsophisticated people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we spoke, we landed, and for the something like pleasurable emotion,
      which the first on my list of Irish acquaintance produced in my mind, I
      distributed among these &ldquo;sons of the waves,&rdquo; more silver than I believe
      they expected Had I bestowed a principality on an Englishman of the same
      rank, he would have been less lavish of the <i>eloquence</i> of gratitude
      on his benefactor, though he might equally have felt the <i>sentiment</i>.&mdash;So
      much for my voyage <i>across the Channel!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This city is to London like a small temple of the Ionic order, whose
      proportions are delicate, whose character is elegance, compared to a vast
      palace, whose Corinthian pillars at once denote strength and magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wondrous extent of London excites our amazement; the compact
      uniformity of Dublin our admiration. But a dispersion is less within the
      <i>coup-d&rsquo;oil</i> of observance, than aggregation, the small, but
      harmonious features of Dublin sieze at once on the eye, while the
      scattered but splendid traits of London, excite a less immediate and more
      progressive admiration, which is often lost in the intervals that occur
      between those objects which are calculated to excite it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London, the miserable shop of a gin seller, and the magnificent palace
      of a Duke, alternately create disgust, or awaken approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Dublin the buildings are not arranged upon such democratic principles.
      The plebian hut offers no foil to the patrician edifice, while their
      splendid and beautiful public structures are so closely connected, as with
      <i>some</i> degree of policy to strike <i>at once</i> upon the eye in the
      happiest combination. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Although in one point of view, there may be a policy in
     this close association of splendid objects, yet it is a
     circumstance of general and just condemnation to all
     strangers who are not confined to a partial survey of the
     city.
</pre>
    <p>
      In other respects this city appears to me to be the miniature copy of our
      imperial original, though minutely imitative in show and glare. Something
      less observant of life&rsquo;s prime luxuries, order and cleanliness, there are
      a certain class of wretches who haunt the streets of Dublin, so emblematic
      of vice, poverty, idleness, and filth, that disgust and pity frequently
      succeed in the minds of the stranger to sentiments of pleasure, surprise,
      and admiration. For the origin of this evil, I must refer you to the
      supreme police of the city; but whatever may be the cause, the effects (to
      an Englishman especially) are dreadful and disgusting beyond all
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although my father has a large connexion here, yet he only gave me a
      letter to his banker, who has forced me to make his house my home for the
      few days I shall remain in Dublin, and whose cordiality and kindness
      sanctions all that has ever been circulated of Irish hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present state of my feelings, however, a party on the banks of the
      <i>Ohio</i>, with a tribe of Indian hunters, would be more consonant to my
      inclinations than the refined pleasures of the most polished circles in
      the world. Yet these warm-hearted people, who find in the name of stranger
      an irresistible lure to every kind attention, will force me to be happy in
      despite of myself, and overwhelm me with invitations, some of which it is
      impossible to resist. My prejudices have received some mortal strokes,
      when I perceived that the natives of this barbarous country have got goal
      for goal with us, in every elegant refinement of life and manners; the
      only difference I can perceive between a London and a Dublin <i>rout</i>
      is, that here, amongst the first class, there is a warmth and cordiality
      of address, which, though perhaps not more sincere than the cold formality
      of British ceremony, is certainly more fascinating. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Every unprejudiced traveller who visits them [the Irish]
     will be as much pleased with their cheerfulness as obliged
     by their hospitality; and will find them a brave, polite,
     and liberal people.&rdquo;&mdash;Philosophical Survey through Ireland
     by Mr. Young.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is not, however, in Dublin I shall expect to find the tone of national
      character and manner; in the first circles of all great cities (as in
      courts) the native features of national character are softened into
      general uniformity, and the genuine feelings of nature are suppressed or
      exchanged for a political compliance with the reigning modes and customs,
      which hold their tenure from the sanction and example of the seat of
      government. Before I close this, I must make one observation, which I
      think will speak more than volumes for the refinement of these people.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my short residence here, I have been forced, in true spirit of
      Irish dissipation, into three parties of a night; and I have upon these
      occasions observed that the most courted objects of popular attention,
      were those whose talents alone endowed them with distinction. Besides
      amateurs, I have met with many professional persons, whom I knew in London
      as public characters, and who are here incorporated in the first and most
      brilliant circles, appearing to feel no other inequality, than what their
      own superiority of genius confers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leave Dublin to-morrow for M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house. It is
      situated in the county of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, on
      the northwest coast of Connaught, which I am told is the classic ground of
      Ireland. The native Irish, pursued by religious and political bigotry,
      made it the asylum of their sufferings, and were separated by a provincial
      barrier from an intercourse with the rest of Ireland, until after the
      Restoration; so I shall have a fair opportunity of beholding the Irish
      character in all its <i>primeval</i> ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Direct your next to Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, which I find is the
      nearest post town to my <i>Kamskatkan palace</i>, where with no other
      society than that of Black stone and Co. I shall lead such a life of
      animal existence, as Prior gives to his Contented Couple&mdash;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the various
      modes of penance invented by the various <i>penance mongers</i> of pious
      austerity, did you ever hear the travelling in an <i>Irish postchaise</i>
      enumerated as a punishment, which by far exceeds horse-hair shirts and
      voluntary flagelation?
    </p>
    <p>
      My first day&rsquo;s journey from Dublin being as wet a one as this moist
      climate and capricious season ever produced, my berlin answered all the
      purposes of a <i>shower bath</i>, while the ventillating principles on
      which the windows were constructed, gave me all the benefit to be derived
      from the <i>breathy</i> influence of the four cardinal points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable any longer to sit tamely enduring the &ldquo;<i>penalty of Adam, the
      season&rsquo;s change</i>,&rdquo; or to sustain any longer the &ldquo;hair-breadth &rsquo;scapes,&rdquo;
       which the most dismantled of vehicles afforded me, together with delays
      and stoppages of every species to be found in the catalogue of
      procrastination and mischance, I took my seat in a mail coach which I met
      at my third stage, and which was going to a town within twenty miles of
      Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. These twenty miles, by far the most
      agreeable of my journey, I performed as we once (in days of boyish
      errantry) accomplished a tour to Wales&mdash;on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had previously sent my baggage, and was happily unincumbered with a
      servant, for the fastidious delicacy of Monsieur Laval would never have
      been adequate to the fatigues of a pedestrian tour through a country wild
      and mountainous as his own native <i>Savoy</i>. But to me every difficulty
      was an effort of some good <i>genius</i> chasing the demon of lethargy
      from the usurpations of my mind&rsquo;s empire. Every obstacle that called for
      exertion was a temporary revival of latent energy; and every unforced
      effort worth an age of indolent indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him who derives gratification from the embellished labours of art,
      rather than the simple but sublime operation of nature, <i>Irish</i>
      scenery will afford little interest; but the bold features of its varying
      landscape, the stupendous attitude of its &ldquo;cloud capt&rdquo; mountains, the
      impervious gloom of its deep embosomed glens, the savage desolation of its
      uncultivated heaths, and boundless bogs, with those rich veins of a
      picturesque champaigne, thrown at intervals into gay expansion by the hand
      of nature, awaken in the mind of the poetic or pictoral traveller, all the
      pleasures of tasteful enjoyment, all the sublime emotions of a rapt
      imagination. And if the glowing fancy of Claude Loraine would have dwelt
      enraptured on the paradisial charms of English landscape, the superior
      genius of Salvator Rosa would have reposed its eagle wing amidst those
      scenes of mysterious sublimity, with which the wildly magnificent
      landscape of Ireland abounds. But the liberality of nature appears to me
      to be here but frugally assisted by the donations of art. Here <i>agriculture</i>
      appears in the least felicitous of he! aspects. The rich treasures of
      Ceres seldom wave their golden heads over the earth&rsquo;s fertile bosom; the
      verdant drapery of young plantations rarely skreens out the coarser
      features of a rigid soil, the cheerless aspect of a gloomy bog; while the
      unvaried surface of the perpetual pasturage which satisfies the eye of the
      interested grazier, disappoints the glance of the tasteful spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within twenty miles of Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I was literally
      dropt by the stage at the foot of a mountain, to which your native <i>Wrekin</i>
      is but a hillock. The dawn was just risen, and flung its gray and reserved
      tints on a scene of which the mountainous region of Capel Cerig will give
      you the most adequate idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountain rising over mountain, swelled like an amphitheatre to those
      clouds which, faintly tinged with the sun&rsquo;s prelusive beams, and rising
      from the earthly summits where they had reposed, incorporated with the
      kindling æther of a purer atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was silent and solitary&mdash;a tranquility tinged with terror, a sort
      of &ldquo;delightful horror,&rdquo; breathed on every side.&mdash;I was alone, and
      felt like the presiding genius of desolation!
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had previously learned my route, after a minute&rsquo;s contemplation of
      the scene before me, I pursued my solitary ramble along a steep and
      trackless path, which wound gradually down towards a great lake, an almost
      miniature sea, that lay embosomed amidst those stupendous heights whose
      rugged forms, now bare, desolate, and barren, now clothed with yellow
      furze and creeping underwood, or crowned with misnic forests, appeared
      towering above my head in endless variety. The progress of the sun
      convinced me that <i>mine</i> must have been slow, as it was perpetually
      interrupted by pauses of curiosity and admiration, and by long and many
      lapses of thoughtful reverie; and fearing that I had lost my way (as I had
      not yet caught a view of the village, in which, seven miles distant from
      the spot where I had left the stage, I was assured I should find an
      excellent breakfast,) I ascended that part of the mountain where, on one
      of its vivid points, a something like a human habitation hung suspended,
      and where I hoped to obtain a <i>carte du pays</i>: the exterior of this
      <i>hut</i>, or <i>cabin</i>, as it is called, like the few I had seen
      which were not built of mud, resembled in one instance the magic palace of
      Chaucer, and was erected with loose stones,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Which, cunningly, were without mortar laid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      thinly thatched with straw; an aperture in the roof served rather to <i>admit</i>
      the air than <i>emit</i> the smoke, a circumstance to which the wretched
      inhabitants of those wretched hovels seem so perfectly naturalized, that
      they live in a constant state of fumigation; and a fracture in the side
      wall (meant I suppose as a substitute for a casement) was stuffed with
      straw, while the door, off its hinges, was laid across the threshhold, as
      a barrier to a little crying boy, who sitting within, bemoaned his
      captivity in a tone of voice not quite so mellifluous as that which Mons.
      Sanctyon ascribes to the crying children of a certain district in Persia,
      but perfectly in unison with the vocal exertions of the companion of his
      imprisonment, a large sow. I approached&mdash;removed the barrier: the boy
      and the animal escaped together, and I found myself alone in the centre of
      this miserable asylum of human wretchedness&mdash;the residence of an <i>Irish
      peasant</i>. To those who have only contemplated this useful order of
      society in England, &ldquo;where every rood of ground maintains its man,&rdquo; and
      where the peasant liberally enjoys the <i>comforts</i> as well as the
      necessaries of life, the wretched picture which the interior of an <i>Irish</i>
      cabin presents, would be at once an object of compassion and disgust. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sometimes excavated from a hill, sometimes erected with
     loose stones, but most generally built of mud, the cabin is
     divided into two apartments, the one littered with straw and
     coarse rugs, and sometimes, (but very rarely) furnished with
     the luxury of a chaff bed, serves as a dormitory not only
     to the family of both sexes, but in general to any animal
     they are so fortunate as to possess; the other chamber
     answers for every purpose of domesticity, though almost
     destitute of every domestic implement, except the iron pot
     in which the potatoes are boiled, and the stool on which
     they are flung. From those wretched hovels (which often
     appears amidst scenes that might furnish the richest models
     to poetic imitation) it is common to behold a group of
     children rush forth at the sound of a horse&rsquo;s foot, or
     carriage wheel, regardless of the season&rsquo;s rigours, in a
     perfect state of nudity, or covered with the drapery of
     wretchedness, which gives to their appearance a still
     stronger character of poverty; yet even in these miserable
     huts you will seldom find the spirit of urbanity absent&mdash;the
     genius of hospitality never. I remember meeting with an
     instance of both, that made a deep impression on my heart;
     in the autumn of 1804, in the course of a morning ramble
     with a charming Englishwoman, in the county of Sligo, I
     stopped to rest myself in a cabin, while she proceeded to
     pay a visit to the respectable family of the O&rsquo;H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s, of
     Nymph&rsquo;s Field: when I entered I found it occupied by an old
     woman and her three granddaughters; two of the young women
     were employed scutching flax, the other in some domestic
     employment. I was instantly hailed with the most cordial
     welcome; the hearth was cleared, the old woman&rsquo;s seat forced
     on me, eggs and potatoes roasted, and an apology for the
     deficiency of bread politely made, while the manners of my
     hostesses betrayed a courtesy that almost amounted to
     adulation. They had all laid by their work on my entrance,
     and when I requested I might not interrupt their avocations,
     one of them replied &ldquo;I hope we know better&mdash;we can work any
     day, but we cannot any day have such a body as you under our
     roof.&rdquo; Surely this was not the manners of a cabin but a
     court.
</pre>
    <p>
      Almost suffocated, and not surprised that it was deserted <i>pro tempo</i>,
      I hastened away, and was attracted towards a ruinous barn by a full chorus
      of female voices&mdash;where a group of young females were seated round an
      old hag who formed the centre of the circle; they were all busily employed
      at their <i>wheels</i>, which I observed went merrily round in exact time
      with their song, and so intently were they engaged by both, that my
      proximity was unperceived. At last the song ceased&mdash;the wheel stood
      still&mdash;and every eye was fixed on the old <i>primum mobile</i> of the
      circle, who, after a short pause, began a <i>solo</i> that gave much
      satisfaction to her young auditors, and taking up the strain, they again
      turned their wheels round in unison.&mdash;The whole was sung in Irish,
      and as soon as I was observed, suddenly ceased; the girls looked down and
      tittered&mdash;and the old woman addressed me <i>sans ceremonie</i>, and
      in a language I now heard for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing that some one among the number must understand English, I
      explained with all possible politeness the cause of my intrusion on this
      little harmonic society. The old woman looked up in my face and shook her
      head; I thought contemptuously&mdash;while the young ones, stifling their
      smiles, exchanged looks of compassion doubtlessly at my ignorance of their
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So many languages a man knows,&rdquo; said Charles V., &ldquo;so many times is he a
      man,&rdquo; and it is certain I never felt myself less invested with the dignity
      of one, than while I stood twirling my stick, and &ldquo;biding the encounter of
      the eyes,&rdquo; and smiles of these &ldquo;spinners in the sun.&rdquo; Here you will say
      was prejudice opposed to prejudice with a vengeance; but I comforted
      myself with the idea that the natives of Greenland, the most gross and
      savage of mortals, compliment a stranger by saying, &ldquo;he is as well bred as
      a Greenlander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While thus situated, a sturdy looking young fellow with that figure and
      openness of countenance so peculiar to the young Irish peasants, and with
      his hose and brogues suspended from a stick over his shoulder, approached
      and hailed the party in Irish: the girls instantly pointed his attention
      towards me; he courteously accosted me in English, and having learnt the
      nature of my dilemma, offered to be my guide&mdash;&ldquo;it will not take me
      above a mile out of my way, and if it did <i>two</i>, it would make no <i>odds</i>,&rdquo;
       said he. I accepted his offer, and we proceeded together over the summit
      of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of our conversation (which was very fluently supported on
      his side,) I learnt, that few strangers ever passing through this remote
      part of the province, and even very many of the gentry here speaking
      Irish, it was a rare thing to meet with any one wholly unacquainted with
      the language, which accounted for the surprise, and I believe contempt, my
      ignorance had excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I enquired into the nature of those choral strains I had heard, he
      replied&mdash;&ldquo;O! as to that, it is according to the old woman&rsquo;s fancy and
      in fact I learnt that Ireland, like Italy, has its <i>improvisatores</i>,
      and that those who are gifted with the impromptu talent are highly
      estimated by their rustic compatriots;&rdquo; and by what he added, I discovered
      that their inspirations are either drawn from the circumstances of the
      moment, from one striking excellence or palpable defect in some of the
      company present, or from some humourous incident, or local event generally
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we arrived at the little <i>auberge</i> of the little village,
      I ordered my courteous guide his breakfast, and having done all due honour
      to my own, we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My route from the village to Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; lay partly
      through a desolate bog, whose burning surface, heated by a vertical sun,
      gave me no inadequate idea of <i>Arabia Deserta</i>; and the pangs of an
      acute headache, brought on by exercise more violent than my still delicate
      constitution was equal to support, determined me to defer my journey until
      the meridian ardours were abated; and taking your Horace from my pocket, I
      wandered into a shady path, &ldquo;impervious to the noontide ray.&rdquo; Throwing my
      &ldquo;listless length&rdquo; at the foot of a spreading beech, I had already got to
      that sweet ode to Lydia, which Scaliger in his enthusiasm declares he
      would rather have written than to have possessed the monarchy of Naples,
      when somebody accosted me in Irish, and then with a &ldquo;God save you, Sir!&rdquo; I
      raised my eyes, and beheld a poor peasant, driving, or rather soliciting,
      a sorry lame cow to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be,&rdquo; said he, taking off his hat, &ldquo;your Honour would be after telling
      me what&rsquo;s the hour?&rdquo; &ldquo;Later than I supposed, my good friend,&rdquo; replied I,
      rising, &ldquo;it is past two.&rdquo; He bowed low, and stroking the face of his
      companion, added, &ldquo;well, the day is yet young, but you and I have a long
      journey before us, my poor Driminduath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how far are you going, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please your Honour, two miles beyond Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my road exactly, and you, Driminduath, and I, may perform the
      journey together.&rdquo; The poor fellow seemed touched and surprised by my
      condescension, and profoundly bowed his sense of it, while the curious <i>triumviri</i>
      set off on their pedestrian tour together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now cast an eye over the person of my <i>compagnon de voyage</i>. It was
      a tall, thin, athletic figure, &ldquo;bony and gaunt,&rdquo; with an expressive
      countenance, marked features, a livid complexion, and a quantity of coarse
      black hair hanging about the face; the drapery was perfectly appropriate
      to the wearer&mdash;an under garment composed of &ldquo;<i>shreds</i> and <i>patches</i>,&rdquo;
       was partially covered with an old great coat of coarse frieze, fastened on
      the breast with a large wooden skewer, the sleeves hanging down on either
      side unoccupied, * and a pair of yarn hose which scarcely reached <i>midleg</i>,
      left the ankle and foot naked.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  This manner of wearing the coat, so genera, among the
     peasantry, is deemed by the natives of the county of Galway
     a remnant of the Spanish mode.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Driminduath</i> seemed to share in the obvious poverty of her master&mdash;she
      was almost an anatomy, and scarcely able to crawl. &ldquo;Poor beast!&rdquo; said he,
      observing I looked at her, &ldquo;Poor beast! little she dreamed of coming back
      the road she went, and little able is she to go it, poor soul; not that I
      am <i>overly</i> sorry I could not get nobody to take her off my hands at
      all at all; though to-be-sure &rsquo;tis better to lose one&rsquo;s cow than
      one&rsquo;s wife, any day in the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had you no alternative?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anan!&rdquo; exclaimed he, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you obliged to part with one or the other?&rdquo; Sorrow is garrulous, and
      in the natural selfishness of its suffering, seeks to lessen the weight of
      its woe by participation. In a few minutes I was master of Murtoch
      O&rsquo;Shaughnassey&rsquo;s story: * he was the husband of a sick wife; the father of
      six children, and a labourer, or <i>cotter</i>, who worked daily
      throughout the year for the hut that sheltered the heads, and the little
      potatoe rick which was the sole subsistence of his family.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Neither the rencontre with, nor the character or story of
     Murtoch, partakes in the least degree of fiction.
</pre>
    <p>
      He had taken a few acres of ground, he said, from his employer&rsquo;s steward,
      to set grass potatoes in, by which he hoped to make something handsome;
      that to enable himself to pay for them he had gone to work in Leinster
      during the last harvest, &ldquo;where, please your Honour,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;a poor
      man gets more for his labour than in Connaught; * but there it was my luck
      (and bad luck it was) to get the shaking fever upon me, so that I returned
      sick and sore to my poor people without a cross to bless myself with, and
      then there was an end to my fine grass potatoes, for devil receive the
      sort they&rsquo;d let me dig till I paid for the ground; and what was worse, the
      steward was going to turn us out of our cabin, because I had not worked
      out the rent with him as usual, and not a potatoe had I for the children;
      besides finding my wife and two boys in a fever: the boys got well, but my
      poor wife has been decaying away ever since; so I was fain to sell my poor
      Driminduath here, which was left me by my gossip, in order to pay my rent
      and get some nourishment for my poor woman, who I believe is just weak at
      heart for the want of it; and so, as I was after telling your Honour, I
      left home yesterday for a <i>fair</i> twenty-five good miles off, but my
      poor Driminduath has got such bad usage of late, and was in such sad
      plight, that nobody would bid nothing for her, and so we are both
      returning home as we went, with full hearts and empty stomachs.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is well known that within these last thirty years the
     Connaught peasant laboured for <i>threepence</i> a day and two
     meals of potatoes and milk, and four pence when he
     maintained himself; while in Leinster the harvest hire rose
     from eight pence to a shilling. Riding out one day near the
     village of Castletown Delvin, in Westmeath, in company with
     the younger branches of the respectable family of the F&mdash;&mdash;ns,
     of that county, we observed two young men lying at a
     little distance from each other in a dry ditch, with some
     lighted turf burning near them; they both seemed on the
     verge of eternity, and we learned from a peasant who was
     passing, that they were Connaught men who had come to
     Leinster to work; that they had been disappointed, and owing
     to want and fatigue, had been first attacked with ague and
     then with fevers of so fatal a nature, that no one would
     suffer them to remain in their cabins: owing to the
     benevolent exertions of my young friends, we however found
     an asylum for these unfortunates, and had the happiness of
     seeing them return comparatively well and happy to their
     native province.
</pre>
    <p>
      This was uttered with an air of despondency that touched my very soul, and
      I involuntarily presented him some sea biscuit I had in my pocket. He
      thanked me, and carelessly added, &ldquo;that it was the first morsel he had
      tasted for twenty-four hours; * not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I can fast with any
      one, and well it is for me I can.&rdquo; He continued brushing an intrusive tear
      from his eye; and the next moment whistling a lively air, he advanced to
      his cow, talking to her in Irish, in a soothing tone, and presenting her
      with such wild flowers and blades of grass as the scanty vegetation of the
      bog afforded, turned round to me with a smile of self-satisfaction and
      said, &ldquo;One can better suffer themselves a thousand times over, than see
      one&rsquo;s poor dumb beast want: it is next, please your Honour, to seeing
      one&rsquo;s child in want&mdash;God help him who has witnessed both!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The temperance of an Irish peasant in this respect is
     almost incredible; many of them are satisfied with one meal
     a day&mdash;none of them exceed two&mdash;breakfast and supper; which
     invariably consists of potatoes, sometimes with, sometimes
     without milk. One of the rules observed by the Finian Band,
     an ancient militia of Ireland, was to eat but once in the
     twenty-four hours.&mdash;See Keating&rsquo;s History of Ireland.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And art thou then (I mentally exclaimed) that intemperate, cruel, idle
      savage, an Irish peasant? with a heart thus tenderly alive to the finest
      feelings of humanity; patiently labouring with daily exertion for what can
      scarcely afford thee a bare subsistence; sustaining the unsatisfied wants
      of nature without a murmur; nurtured in the hope (the <i>disappointed hope</i>)
      of procuring nourishment for <i>her</i>, dearer to thee than thyself,
      tender of thy animal as thy child, and suffering the consciousness of <i>their</i>
      wants to absorb all consideration of thy own; and resignation smooths the
      furrow which affliction has traced upon thy brow, and the national exility
      of thy character cheers and supports the natural susceptibility of thy
      heart.&rdquo; In fact, he was at this moment humming an Irish song by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not tell you that the first village we arrived at, I furnished him
      with the means of procuring him a comfortable dinner for himself and
      Driminduath, and advice and medicine from the village apothecary for his
      wife. Poor fellow! his surprise and gratitude was expressed in the true
      hyperbola of Irish emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime I walked on to examine the ruins of an abbey, where in about half
      an hour I was joined by Murtoch and his patient companion, whom he assured
      me he had regaled with some hay, as he had himself with a glass of whisky.&mdash;What
      a dinner for a famishing man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a dreadful habit, Murtoch,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so, please your Honour,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but then it is meat, drink,
      and clothes to us, for we forget we have but little of one and less of the
      other, when we get <i>the drop</i> within us; Och, long life to them that
      lightened the tax on the whiskey, for by my safe conscience, if they had
      left it on another year we should have forgotten how to drink it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shall make no comment on Murtoch&rsquo;s unconscious phillippic against the
      legislature, but surely a government has little right to complain of those
      popular disorders to which in a certain degree it may be deemed accessory,
      by removing the strongest barrier that confines within moral bounds the
      turbulent passions of the lower orders of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment, I found that Murtoch had only purchased for his sick
      wife a little wine and a small piece of bacon: * both, he assured me, were
      universal and sovereign remedies, and better than any thing the <i>phisicianers</i>
      could prescribe, to keep the disorder <i>from the heart</i> ** The spirits
      of Murtoch were now quite afloat, and during the rest of our journey the
      vehemence, pliancy, and ardour of the Irish character strongly betrayed
      itself in the manners of this poor unmodified Irishman; while the natural
      facetiousness of a temperament &ldquo;complexionably pleasant,&rdquo; was frequently
      succeeded by such heartrending accounts of poverty and distress, as shed
      involuntary tears on those cheeks which but a moment before were distended
      by the exertions of a boisterous laugh.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is common to see them come to gentlemen&rsquo;s houses with a
     little vial bottle to beg a table spoonful of wine (for a
     sick relative,) which they esteem the elixir of life.

     ** To be able to keep any disorder from the heart, is
     supposed, (by the lower orders of the Irish,) to be the
     secret of longevity.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more wildly sweet than the whistle or song of the
      ploughman or labourer as we passed along; it was of so singular a nature,
      that I frequently paused to catch it; it is a species of voluntary
      recitative, and so melancholy, that every plaintive note breathes on the
      heart of the auditor a tale of hopeless despondency or incurable woe. By
      heavens! I could have wept as I listened, and found a luxury in tears. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. Walker, in his Historical Memoir of the Irish Bards,
     has given a specimen of the Irish plough-tune? and adds,
     &ldquo;While the Irish ploughman drives his team, and the female
     peasant milks her cow, they warble a succession of wild
     notes which bids defiance to the rules of composition, yet
     are inexpressibly sweet.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The evening was closing in fast, and we were within a mile of Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      when, to a day singularly fine, succeeded one of the most violent storms
      of rain and wind I had ever witnessed. Murtoch, who seemed only to regard
      it on my account, insisted on throwing his great coat over me, and pointed
      to a cabin at a little distance, where, he said, &ldquo;if my Honour would
      demean myself so far, I could get good shelter for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that, Murtoch?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murtoch shook his head, and looking full in my face, said something in
      Irish; which at my request he translated&mdash;the words were&mdash;&ldquo;Happy
      are <i>they</i> whose roof shelters the head of the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it indeed a source of happiness to you, Murtoch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murtoch endeavoured to convince me it <i>was</i>, even upon a <i>selfish</i>
      principle: &ldquo;For (said he) it is thought right lucky to have a stranger
      sleep beneath one&rsquo;s roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If superstition was ever thus on the side of benevolence, even reason
      herself would hesitate to depose her. We had now reached the door of the
      cabin, which Murtoch opened without ceremony, saying as he entered&mdash;&ldquo;May
      God and the Virgin Mary pour a blessing on this house!&rdquo; The family, who
      were all circled round a fine turf fire that blazed on the earthen hearth,
      replied, &ldquo;Come in, and a thousand welcomes&rdquo;&mdash;for Murtoch served as
      interpreter, and translated as they were spoken these warm effusions of
      Irish cordiality. The master of the house, a venerable old man, perceiving
      me, made a low bow, and added, &ldquo;You are welcome, and ten thousand
      welcomes, <i>gentleman.</i>&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Failte augus cead ro ag duine nasal.&rdquo; The term gentleman,
     however, is a very inadequate version of the Irish nasal,
     which is an epitthet of superiority that indicates more than
     mere gentility of birth can bestow, although that requisite
     is also included. In a curious dialogue between Ossian and
     St. Patrick, in an old Irish poem, in which the former
     relates the combat between Oscar and Ilian, St, Patrick
     solicits him to the detail, addressing him as &ldquo;Ossian uasal,
     a mhic Fionne&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ossian the Noble&mdash;the son of Fingal.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So you see I hold my letter patent of nobility in my countenance, for I
      had not yet divested myself of Murtoch&rsquo;s costume&mdash;while in the act,
      the best stool was wiped for me, the best seat at the fire forced on me,
      and on being admitted into the social circle, I found its central point
      was a round oaken stool heaped with smoking potatoes thrown promiscuously
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To partake of this national diet I was strongly and courteously solicited,
      while as an incentive to an appetite that needed none, the old dame
      produced what she called a <i>madder</i> of sweet milk, in
      contradistinction to the sour milk of which the rest partook; while the
      cow that sup plied the luxury slumbered most amicably with a large pig at
      no great distance from where I sat, and Murtoch glancing an eye at <i>both</i>,
      and then looking at me, seemed to say, &ldquo;You see into what snug quarters we
      have got.&rdquo; While I (as I sat with my damp clothes smoking by the turf
      fire, my madder of milk in one hand, and hot potatoe in the other) assured
      him by a responsible glance, that I was fully sensible of the comforts of
      our situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as supper was finished the old man said grace, the family piously
      blessed themselves, and the stool being removed, the hearth swept, and the
      fire replenished from the bog, Murtoch threw himself on his back along a
      bench, * and unasked began a song, the wild and plaintive melody of which
      went at once to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had concluded, I was told it was the lamentation of the poor Irish
      for the loss of their <i>glibbs</i> or long tresses, of which they were
      deprived by the arbitrary will of Henry VIII.&mdash;The song (composed in
      his reign) is called the <i>Coulin</i> ** which I am told is literally,
      the fair ringlet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This curious vocal position is of very ancient origin in
     Connaught, though by no means prevalent. Formerly the
     songster not only lay on his back, but had a weight pressed
     on his chest. The author&rsquo;s father recollects having seen a
     man in the county of Mayo, of the name of O&rsquo;Melvill, who
     sung for him in this position some years back.

     **  The Cualin is one of the most popular and beautiful
     Irish airs estant.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the English had drawn a pale round their conquests in this country,
      such of the inhabitants as were compelled to drag on their existence
      beyond the barrier, could no longer afford to cover their heads with
      metal, and were necessitated to rely on the resistance of their matted
      locks. At length this necessity became &ldquo;the fashion of their choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partiality of the ancient Irish to long hair is still to be traced in
      their descendants of both sexes, the women in particular; for I observed
      that the young ones only wore their &ldquo;native ornament of <i>hair</i>,&rdquo;
       which sometimes flows over their shoulders, sometimes is fastened up in
      tresses, with a pin or bodkin. A fashion more in unison with grace and
      nature, though less in point of formal neatness, than the round-eared caps
      and large hats of our rustic fair of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every word of Murtoch&rsquo;s lamentation was accompanied by the sighs
      and mournful lamentations of his auditors, who seemed to sympathize as
      tenderly in the sufferings of their progenitors, as though they had
      themselves been the victims of the tyranny which had caused them. The arch
      policy of &ldquo;the ruthless king,&rdquo; who destroyed at once the records of a
      nation&rsquo;s woes, by extirpating &ldquo;the tuneful race,&rdquo; whose art would have
      perpetuated them to posterity, never appeared to me in greater force than
      at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst, however, of the melancholy which involved the mourning
      auditors of Murtoch, a piper entered and seated himself by the fire, <i>sans
      façon</i>, drew his pipes from under his coat, and struck up an Irish lilt
      of such inspiring animation, as might have served St. Basil of Limoges,
      the merry patron of dancing, for a jubilate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment, in the true pliability of Irish temperament, the whole
      pensive group cheered up, flung away their stools, and as if bit to merry
      madness by a tarantula, set to dancing jigs with all their hearts, and all
      their <i>strength</i> into the bargain. Murtoch appeared not less skilled
      in the dance than song; and every one (according to the just description
      of Goldsmith, who was a native of this province,) seemed
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;To seek renown,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      By holding out to tire each other down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Although much amused by this novel style of devotion at the shrine of
      Terpsichore, yet as the night was now calm, and an unclouded moon
      dispersed the gloom of twilight obscurity, I arose to pursue my journey.
      Murtoch would accompany me, though our hospitable friends did their utmost
      to prevail on both to remain for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I insisted on my host receiving a trifle, I observed poverty
      struggling with pride, and gratitude superior to both: he at last
      reluctantly consented to be prevailed on, by my assurance of forgetting to
      call on them again when I passed that way, if I were now denied. I was
      followed for several paces by the whole family, who parted <i>with</i>, as
      they <i>received</i> me, with blessings,&mdash;for their courtesy upon all
      occasions, seems interwoven with their religion, and not to be pious in
      their forms of etiquette, is not to be polite.
    </p>

      yet who, with the ever ready smile of heart-felt welcome, are willing to
      share that hard earned little, with the weary traveller whom chance
      conducts to your threshold, or the solitary wanderer whom necessity throws
      upon your bounty. How did my heart smite me, while I received the cordial
      rites of hospitality from your hands, for the prejudices I had hitherto
      nurtured against your characters. But your smiling welcome, and parting
      benediction, retributed my error&mdash;in the feeling of remorse they
      awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when I reached Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a large,
      ugly, irregular town, near the sea coast; but fortunately meeting with a
      chaise, I threw myself into it, gave Murtoch my address, (who was all
      amazement at discovering I was son to the Lord of the Manor,) and arrived
      without further adventure at this antique <i>chateau</i>, more gratified
      by the result of my little pedestrian tour, than if (at least in the
      present state of my feelings,) I had performed it Sesostris-like, in a
      triumphal chariot, drawn by kings; for &ldquo;so weary, stale, flat, and
      unprofitable,&rdquo; appear to me the tasteless pleasures of the world I have
      left, that every sense, every feeling, is in a state of revolt against its
      sickening joys, and their concomitant sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu! I am sending this off by a courier extraordinary, to the next
      post-town, in the hope of receiving one from you by the same hand.

      LETTER III.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> perceive my
      father emulates the policy of the British Legislature, and delegates
      English ministers to govern his Irish domains. Who do you think is his <i>fac
      totum</i> here? The rascally son of his cunning Leicestershire steward,
      who unites all his father&rsquo;s artifice to a proportionable share of roguery
      of his own, I have had some reason to know the fellow; but his servility
      of manner, and apparent rigid discharge of his duties, has imposed on my
      father; who, with all his superior mind, is to be imposed on, by those who
      know how to find out the clew to his fallibility: his noble soul can never
      stoop to dive into the minute vices of a rascal of this description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clendinning was absent from M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house when I
      arrived, but attended me the next morning at breakfast, with that fawning
      civility of manner I abhor, and which, contrasted with the manly
      courteousness of my late companion, never appeared more grossly obvious.
      He endeavoured to amuse me with a detail of the ferocity, cruelty, and
      uncivilized state of those among whom (as he hinted,) I was banished for
      my sins. He had now, he said, been near five years among them, and had
      never met an individual of the lower order, who did not deserve a halter
      at least: for his part, he had kept a tight hand over them, and he was
      justified in so doing, or his lord would be the sufferer; for few of them
      would pay their rents till their cattle were driven, or some such measure
      was taken with them. And as for the labourers and workmen, a slave-driver
      was the only man fit to deal with them; they were all rebellious, idle,
      cruel, and treacherous; and for his part, he never expected to leave the
      country with his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not possible a better defence for the imputed turbulence of the
      Irish peasantry could be made, than that which lurked in the unprovoked
      accusations of this narrow-minded sordid steward, who, it is evident,
      wished to forestall the complaints of those on whom he had exercised the
      native tyranny of his disposition (even according to his own account,) by
      every species of harrassing oppression within the compass of his ability.
      For if power is a dangerous gift even in the regulated mind of elevated
      rank, what does it be come in the delegated authority of ignorance,
      meanness, and illiberality? *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A horde of tyrants exist in Ireland, in a class of men
     that are unknown in England, in the multitude of agents of
     absentees, small proprietors, who are the pure Irish
     squires, middle men, who take large farms, and squeeze out a
     forced kind of profit by letting them in small parcels;
     lastly, the little farmers themselves, who exercise the same
     insolence they receive from their superiors, on those
     unfortunate beings who are placed at the extremity of the
     scale of degradation&mdash;the Irish peasantry.&mdash;An Enquiry into
     the Causes of Popular Discontents in Ireland.
</pre>
    <p>
      My father, however, by frequent visitations to his Irish estates (within
      these few years at least,) must afford to his suffering tenantry an
      opportunity of redress; for who that ever approached him with a <i>tear</i>
      of suffering, but left his presence with a tear of gratitude! But many,
      very many of the English nobility who hold immense tracts of land in this
      country, and draw from hence in part the suppliance of their luxuries,
      have never visited their estates, since conquest first put them in the
      possession of their ancestors. Ours, you know, fell to us in the
      Cromwellian wars, but since the time of General M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      who earned them by the sword, my father, his lineal descendant, is the
      first of the family who ever visited them. And certainly, a wish to
      conciliate the affections of his tenantry, could alone induce him to spend
      so much of his time here as he has done; for the situation of this place
      is bleak and solitary, and the old mansion, like the old manor houses of
      England, has neither the architectural character of an antique structure,
      nor the accommodation of a modern one.

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On enquiring for the key of the library, Mr. Clendinning informed me his
      lord always took it with him, but that a box of books had come from
      England a few days before my arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I suspected, they were all law books&mdash;well, be it so; there are
      few sufferings more acute than those which forbid complaint, because they
      are self-created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days have elapsed since I began this letter, and I have been
      prevented from continuing it merely for want of something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot now sit down, as I once did, and give you a history of my ideas
      or sensations, in the deficiency of fact or incident; for I have survived
      my sensations, and my ideas are dry and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot now trace my joys to their source, or my sorrows to their spring,
      for I am destitute of their present, and insensible to their former
      existence. The energy of youthful feeling is subdued, and the vivacity of
      warm emotion worn out by its own violence. I have lived too fast in a
      moral as well as a physical sense, and the principles of my intellectual,
      as well as my natural constitution are, I fear, fast hastening to decay I
      live the tomb of my expiring mind, and preserve only the consciousness of
      my wretched state, without the power, and almost without the wish to be
      otherwise than what I am. And yet, God knows, I am nothing less than
      contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you hear my journal? I rise late to my solitary breakfast, because
      it is solitary; then to study, or rather to yawn over <i>Giles</i> versus
      <i>Haystack</i>, until (to check the creeping effects of lethargy) I rise
      from my reading desk, and lounge to a window, which commands a boundless
      view of a boundless bog; then, &ldquo;with what appetite I may,&rdquo; sit down to a
      joyless dinner. Sometimes, when seduced by the blandishments of an even
      ing singularly beautiful, I quit my <i>den</i> and <i>prowl</i> down to
      the sea shore where, throwing myself at the foot of some cliff that
      &ldquo;battles o&rsquo;er the deep,&rdquo; I fix my vacant eye on the stealing waves that
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Idly swell against the rocky coast,

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then wet with the ocean spray and evening dew, return to my bed, merely to
      avoid the intrusive civilities of Mr. Clendinning. Thus wear the hours
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had heard that the neighbourhood about M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house was good: I can answer for its being populous. Although I took every
      precaution to prevent my arrival being known, yet the natives have come
      down on me in hordes, and this in all the form of <i>haut ton</i>, as the
      innumerable cards of the clans of Os and Macs evince. I have, however,
      neither been visible to the visitants, nor accepted their invitations: for
      &ldquo;man delights me not, nor woman either.&rdquo; Nor woman either! Oh! uncertainty
      of all human propensities! Yet so it is, that every letter that composes
      the word <i>woman!</i> seems cabalistical, and rouses every principle of
      aversion and disgust within me; while I often ask myself with Tasso,

    <p>
      It is certain, that the diminutive body of our worthy steward, is the
      abode of the transmigrated soul of some <i>West Indian</i> planter. I have
      been engaged these two days in listening to, and retributing those
      injuries his tyranny has inflicted, in spite of his rage, eloquence, and
      threats, none of which have been spared. The victims of his oppression
      haunt me in my walks, fearful lest their complaints should come to the
      knowledge of this puissant <i>major domo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said I to one of the sufferers, after a detail of seized geese,
      pounded cows, extra labour cruelly extorted, ejectments, &amp;c. &amp;c..
      given in all the tedious circumlocution of Irish oratory,&mdash;&ldquo;why not
      complain to my father when he comes among you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Becaise, please your Honour, my Lord stays but a few days at a time here
      together, nor that same neither; besides, we be loth to trouble his
      Lordship, for feard it would be after coming to Measther Clendinning&rsquo;s
      ears, which would be the ruination of us all; and then when my Lord is at
      the Lodge, which he mostly is, he is always out amongst the quality, so he
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Lodge?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, please your Honour, where my Lord mostly takes up when he comes
      here, the place that belonged to Measther Clendinning, who call ed it the
      <i>Lodge</i>, becaise the good old Irish name that was upon it did not
      suit his fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I asked Mr. Clendinning if my father did not sometimes
      reside at the Lodge? He seemed surprised at my information, and said, that
      was the name he had given to a ruinous old place which, with a few acres
      of indifferent land, he had purchased of his hard labour, and which his
      Lord having taken an unaccountable liking to, rented from him, and was
      actually the tenant of his own steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      O! what arms of recrimination I should be furnished with against my
      rigidly moral father, should I discover this remote <i>Cassino</i>, (for
      remote I understand it is) to be the <i>harem</i> of some wild Irish <i>Sultana</i>;
      for I strongly suspect &ldquo;that metal more attractive&rdquo; than the cause he
      assigns, induces him to pay an annual visit to a country to which, till
      within these few years, he nurtured the strongest prejudices. You know
      there are but nineteen years between him and my brother; and his feelings
      are so unblunted by vicious pursuits, his life has been guided by such
      epicurian principles of enjoyment, that he still retains much of the first
      warm flush of juvenile existence, and has only sacrificed to time, its
      follies and its ignorance. I swear, at this moment he is a younger man
      than either of his sons; the one chilled by the coldness of an icy
      temperament into premature old age, and the other!!!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Murtoch
      has been to see me. I have procured him a little farm, and am answerable
      for the rent. I sent his wife some rich wine; she is recovering very fast.
      Murtoch is all gratitude for the wine, but I perceive his faith still lies
      in the <i>bacon!</i>

      country, I mounted my horse. So I determined to roam free and unrestrained
      by the presence of a servant, to Mr. Clendinning&rsquo;s utter amazement, I
      ordered a few changes of linen, my drawing-book, and pocket escritoire, to
      be put in a small valice, which, with all due humility, I had strapped on
      the back of my steed, whom, by the bye, I expect will be as celebrated as
      the <i>Rozinante</i> of Don Quixote, or the <i>Beltenbros L&rsquo;Amadis de Gaul</i>;
      and thus accoutred set off on my peregrination, the most listless knight
      that ever entered on the lists of errantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will smile, when I tell you my first point of attraction was the <i>Lodge</i>;
      to which (though with some difficulty) I found my way; for it lies in a
      most wild and unfrequented direction, but so infinitely superior in
      situation to M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house, that I no longer wonder at my
      father&rsquo;s preference. Every feature that constitutes either the beauty or
      sublime of landscape, is here finely combined. Groves druidically
      venerable&mdash;mountains of Alpine elevation&mdash;expansive lakes, and
      the boldest and most romantic sea-coast I ever beheld, alternately
      diversify and enrich its scenery; while a number of young and flourishing
      plantations evince the exertion of taste in my father, he certainly has
      not betrayed in the disposition of his hereditary domains. I found this <i>Tusculum</i>
      inhabited only by a decent old man and his superannuated wife. Without
      informing them who I was, I made a feigning wish to make the place a
      pretext for visiting it. The old man smiled at the idea, and shook his
      head, presuming that I must be indeed a stranger in the country, as my
      accent denoted, for that this spot belonged to a great <i>English Lord</i>,
      whom he verily believed would not resign it for his own fine place some
      miles off; but when, with some jesuitical artifice I endeavoured to trace
      the cause of this attachment, he said it was his Lordship&rsquo;s fancy, and
      that there was no accounting for people&rsquo;s fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but is it the house only that seized on
      your Lord&rsquo;s fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, for the matter of that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the lands are far more finer; the
      house, though large, being no great things.&rdquo; I begged in this instance to
      judge for myself, and a few shillings procured me not only free egress,
      but the confidence of the ancient <i>Cicerone</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fancied <i>harem</i>, however, I found not only divested of its
      expected fair inhabitant, but wholly destitute of furniture, except what
      filled a bedroom occupied by my father, and an apartment which was <i>locked</i>.
      The old man with some tardiness produced the key, and I found this
      mysterious chamber was only a study; but closer inspection discovered that
      almost all the books related to the language, history, and antiquities of
      Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you see, in fact, my father&rsquo;s <i>Sultana</i> is no other than the <i>Irish
      Muse</i>; and never was son so tempted to become the rival of his father,
      since the days of Antiochus and Stratonice. For, at a moment when my
      taste, like my senses, is flat and palled, nothing can operate so strongly
      as an incentive, as novelty. I strongly suspect that my father was aware
      of this, and that he had despoiled the temple, to prevent me becoming a
      worshipper at the same shrine. For the old man said he had received a
      letter from his Lord, ordering away all the furniture (except that of his
      own bed-room and study) to the manor house; the study and bed-room,
      however, will suffice me, and here I shall certainly pitch my
      head-quarters until my father&rsquo;s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already had some occasions to remark, that the warm susceptible
      character of the Irish is open to the least indication of courtesy and
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      My <i>politesse</i> to this old man, opened every sluice of confidence in
      his breast, and, as we walked down the avenue together, having thrown the
      bridle over my horse&rsquo;s neck, and offered him my arm, for he was lame, I
      enquired how this beautiful farm fell into the hands of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      still concealing from him that it was his son who demanded the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, your Honour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the farm, though beautiful is small;
      however, it made the best part of what remained of the patrimony of the
      Prince, when&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Prince?&rdquo; interrupted I, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the Prince of Inismore, to be sure, jewel, whose great forefathers
      once owned the half of the barony, from the Red Bog to the sea-coast. Och!
      it is a long story, but I heard my grandfather tell it a thousand times,
      how a great Prince of Inismore in the wars of Queen Elizabeth, had here a
      castle and a great tract of land on the <i>borders</i>, of which he was
      deprived, as the story runs, becaise he would neither cut his <i>glibbs</i>,
      shave his upper lip, nor shorten his shirt; * and so he was driven, with
      the rest of us beyond the <i>pale</i>. The family, however, after a while,
      flourished greater nor ever. Och, and it is themselves that might, for
      they were true Milesians bread and born, every mother&rsquo;s soul of them. O
      not a drop of <i>Strongbonean</i> flowed in their Irish veins, agrah!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * From the earliest settlement of the English in this
     country, an inquisitorial persecution had been carried on
     against the national costume. In the reign of Henry V. there
     was an act passed against even the English colonists wearing
     a whisker on the upper lip, like the Irish; and in 1616, the
     Lord Deputy, in his instructions to the Lord President and
     Council, directed, that such as appeared in the Irish robes
     or mantles, should be punished by fine and imprisonment.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I was after telling your Honour, the family flourished, and beat
      all before them, for they had an army of <i>galloglasses</i> at their
      back, * until the Cromwellian wars broke out, and those same cold-hearted
      Presbyterians, battered the fine <i>old ancient</i> castle of Inismore,
      and left in the condition it now stands; and what was worse nor that, the
      poor old Prince was put to death in the arms of his fine young son, who
      tried to save him, and that by one of Cromwell&rsquo;s English Generals, who
      received the town lands of Inismore, which lie near Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      as his reward. Now this English General who murdered the Prince, was no
      other than the ancestor of my Lord, to whom these estates descended from
      father to son. Ay, you may well start, Sir, it was a woful piece of
      business; for of all their fine estates, nothing was left to the Princes
      of Inismore, but the ruins of their old castle, and the rocks that
      surround it; except this tight little bit of an estate here, on which the
      father of the present Prince built this house; becaise his Lady, with whom
      he got a handsome fortune, and who was descended from the Kings of
      Connaught, took a dislike to the castle; the story going that it was
      haunted by the murdered Prince; and what with building of this house, and
      living like an Irish Prince, as he was every inch of him, and spending
      3000 l. a year out of 300 l., when he died (and the sun never shone on
      such a funeral; the whiskey ran about like <i>ditch water</i>, and the
      country was stocked with pipes and tobacco for many a long year after. For
      the present Prince, his son, would not be a bit behind his father in any
      thing, and so signs on him, for he is not worth one guinea this blessed
      day, Christ save him;)&mdash;well, as I was saying, when he died, he left
      things in a sad way, which his son is not the man to mend, for he was the
      spirit of a king, and lives in as much state as one to this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  The second order of military in Ireland.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where, where does he live?&rdquo; interrupted I, with breathless
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued this living chronicle, in the true spirit of Irish
      replication, &ldquo;he did live there in that Lodge, as they call it now, and in
      that room where my Lord keeps his books, was our young Princess born; her
      father never had but her, and loves her better than his own heart&rsquo;s blood,
      and well he may, the blessing of the Virgin Mary and the Twelve Apostles
      light on her sweet head. Well, the Prince would never let it come near
      him, that things were not going on well, and continued to take at great
      rents, farms that brought him in little; for being a Prince and a
      Milesian, it did not become him to look after such matters, and every
      thing was left to stewards and the like, until things coming to the worst,
      a rich English gentleman, as it was said, come over here and offered the
      Prince, through his steward, a good round sum of money on this place,
      which the Prince, being harrassed by his <i>spalpeen</i> creditors, and
      wanting a little ready money more than any other earthly thing, consented
      to receive; the gentleman sending him word he should have his own time;
      but scarcely was the mortgage a year old, when this same Englishman, (Oh,
      my curse lie about him, Christ pardon me,) foreclosed it, and the fine old
      Prince not having as much as a shed to shelter his gray hairs under, was
      forced to fit up part of the old ruined castle, and open those rooms which
      it had been said were haunted. Discharging many of his old servants, he
      was accompanied to the castle by the family steward, the <i>fosterers</i>,
      the <i>nurse</i> * the harper, and Father John, the chaplain.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  The custom of retaining the nurse who reared the
     children, has ever been, and is still in force among the
     most respectable families in Ireland, as it is still in
     modern, and was formerly in ancient Greece, and they are
     probably both derived from the same origin. We read, that
     when Rebecca left her father&rsquo;s house to marry Isaac at
     Beersheba, the nurse was sent to accompany her. But in
     Ireland, not only the nurse herself, but her husband and
     children are objects of peculiar regard and attention, and
     are called fosterers. The claims of these fosterers
     frequently descend from generation to generation, and the
     tie which unite? them is indissoluble.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, it was a piteous sight the day he left this: he was leaning on the
      Lady Glorvina&rsquo;s arm as he walked out to the chaise, &lsquo;James Tyral,&rsquo; says he
      to me in Irish, for I caught his eye; &lsquo;James Tyral,&rsquo; but he could say no
      more, for the old tenants kept crying about him, and he put his mantle to
      his eyes and hurried into the chaise; the Lady Glorvina kissing her hand
      to us all, and crying bitterly till she was out of sight. But then, Sir,
      what would you have of it; the Prince shortly after found out that this
      same Mr. <i>Mortgagee</i>, was no other than a spalpeen steward of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s.
      It was thought he would have run mad when he found that almost the last
      acre of his hereditary lands was in the possession of the servant of his
      hereditary enemy; for so deadly is the hatred he bears to my Lord, that
      upon my conscience, I believe the young Prince who held the bleeding body
      of his murdered father in his arms, felt not greater for the murderer,
      than our Prince does for that murder&rsquo;s descendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now my Lord is just such a man as God never made better, and wishing with
      all the veins in his heart to serve the old Prince, and do away all
      difference between them, what does he do, jewel, but writes him a mighty
      pretty letter, offering this house and a part of the lands a present. O!
      divil a word of lie I&rsquo;m after telling you; but what would you have of it,
      but this offer sets the Prince madder than all; for you know that this was
      an insult on his honour, which warmed every drop of Milesian blood in his
      body for he would rather starve to death all his life, than have it
      thought he would be obligated to any body at all at all for wherewithal to
      support him; so with that the Prince writes him a letter: it was brought
      by the old steward, who knew every line of the contents of it, though
      divil a line in it but two, and that same was but one and a half, as one
      may say, and this it was, as the old steward told me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son of the son of the son&rsquo;s son of Bryan, Prince of Inismore, can
      receive no favour from the descendant of his ancestor&rsquo;s murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it was plain enough to be seen, that my Lord took this to heart, as
      well he might, faith; however, he considered that it came from a
      misfortunate Prince, he let it drop, and so this was all that ever passed
      between them; however, he was angry enough with his steward, but Measther
      Clendinning put his <i>comehither</i> on him, and convinced him that the
      biggest rogue alive was an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Prince!&rdquo; I interrupted eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, jewel, the prince lives away in the old Irish fashion, only he has
      not a Christian soul now at all at all, most of the old Milesian gentry
      having quit the country; besides, the Prince being in a bad state of
      health, and having nearly lost the use of his limbs, and his heart being
      heavy, and his purse light; for all that he keeps up the old Irish customs
      and dress, letting nobody eat at the same table but his daughter, * not
      even his Lady when she was alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * M&rsquo;Dermot, Prince of Coolavin, never suffered his wife to
     sit at table with him; although his daughter-in-law was
     permitted to that honour, as she was the descendant from the
     royal family of the O&rsquo;Connor.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think the son of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; would have
      no chance of obtaining an audience from the Prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the young gentleman that they say is come to M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house? why about as much chance as his father, but by my conscience,
      that&rsquo;s a bad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your young Princess, is she as implacable as her father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, faith! I cannot well tell you what the Lady Glorvina is, for she is
      like nothing upon the face of God&rsquo;s creation but herself. I do not know
      how it comes to pass, that every mother&rsquo;s soul of us loves her better nor
      the Prince; ay, by my conscience, and fear her too; for well may they fear
      her, on the score of her great learning, being brought up by Father John,
      the chaplain, and spouting Latin faster nor the priest of the parish: and
      we may well love her, for she is a saint upon earth, and a great <i>physicianer</i>
      to boot; curing all the sick and maimed for twenty miles round. Then she
      is so proud, that divil a one soul of the quality will she visit in the
      whole barony, though she will sit in a smoky cabin for hours together, to
      talk to the poor: besides all this, she will sit for hours at her Latin
      and Greek, after the family are gone to bed, and yet you will see her up
      with the dawn, running like a doe about the rocks; her fine yellow hair
      streaming in the wind, for all the world like a mermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! my blessing light on her every day she sees the light, for she is
      the jewel of a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child! say you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure I think her one; for many a time I carried her in these
      arms, and taught her to bless herself in Irish; but she is no child
      either, for as one of our old Irish songs says, &lsquo;Upon her cheek we see
      love&rsquo;s letter sealed with a damask rose.&rsquo; * But if your Honour has any
      curiosity you may judge for yourself; for matins and vespers are
      celebrated every day in the year, in the old chapel belonging to the
      castle, and the whole family attend.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is a line of a song of one Dignum, who composed in
     his native language, but could neither read nor write nor
     spoke any language but his own. &ldquo;I have seen,&rdquo; said the
     celebrated Edmund Burke (who in his boyish days had known
     him) &ldquo;some of his effusions translated into English, but was
     assured, by judges, that they fell far short of the
     originals; yet they contained some graces, &lsquo;snatched beyond
     the reach of ark&rsquo; &ldquo;&mdash;Vide Life of Burke.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are strangers also permitted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith and it&rsquo;s themselves that are; but few indeed trouble them, though
      none are denied. I used to get to mass myself sometimes, but it is now too
      far to walk for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was sufficient, I waited to hear no more, but repaid my communicative
      companion for his information, and rode off, having inquired the road to
      Inismore from the first man I met.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be vain, it would be impossible to describe the emotion which the
      simple tale of this old man awakened. The descendant of a murderer! The
      very scoundrel steward of my father revelling in the property of a man who
      shelters his aged head beneath the ruins of those walls where his
      ancestors bled under the uplifted sword of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why this, you will say, is the romance of a novel-read schoolboy. Are we
      not all, the little and the great, descended from assassins; was not the
      first born man a fratricide? and still, on the field of unappeased
      contention, does not &ldquo;man the murderer, meet the murderer, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, &lsquo;tis all true; humanity acknowledges it and shudders. But still
      I wish <i>my</i> family had never possessed an acre of ground in this
      country, or possessed it on other terms. I always knew the estate fell
      into our family in the civil wars of Cromwell, and, in the world&rsquo;s
      language, was the well-earned meed of my progenitor&rsquo;s valour; but I seemed
      to hear it now for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad, however, that this old Irish chieftain is such a ferocious
      savage; that the pity his fate awakens is qualified by aversion for his
      implacable, irascible disposition. I am glad his daughter is <i>red headed</i>,
      a pedant, and a romp; that she spouts Latin like the priest of the parish,
      and cures sore fingers; that she avoids genteel society, where her ideal
      rank would procure her no respect, and her unpolished ignorance, by force
      of contrast, make her feel her real inferiority; that she gossips among
      the poor peasants, over whom she can reign liege Lady; and, that she has
      been brought up by a jesuitical priest, who has doubtlessly rendered her
      as bigoted and illiberal as himself. All this soothes my conscientous
      throes of feeling and compassion; for oh! if this savage chief was
      generous and benevolent, as he is independent and spirited; if this
      daughter was amiable and intelligent, as she must be simple and
      unvitiated! But I dare not pursue the supposition, It is better as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      You would certainly never guess that the <i>Villa di Marino</i>, from
      whence I date the continuation of my letter, was simply a <i>fisherman&rsquo;s
      hut</i> on the seacoast, half way between the Lodge and Castle of
      Inismore, that is, seven miles distant from each. Determined on attending
      vespers at Inismore, I was puzzling my brain to think where or how I
      should pass the night, when this hut caught my eye, and I rode up to it to
      inquire if there was any inn in the neighbourhood, where a <i>chevalier
      errant</i> could shelter his adventurous head for a night; but I was
      informed the nearest inn was fifteen miles distant, so I bespoke a little
      fresh straw, and a clean blanket which hung airing on some fishing tackle
      outside the door of this <i>marine hotel</i>, in preference to riding so
      far for a bed, at so late an hour as that in which the vespers would be
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mine host of the Atlantic promised me, pointing to a little board
      suspended over the door, on which was written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Dry Lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My landlord, however, convinced me his hotel afforded something better
      than good dry lodging; for entreating me to alight, till a shower passed
      over which was beginning to fall, I entered the hut, and found his wife, a
      sturdy lad their eldest son, and two naked little ones, seated at their
      dinner, and enjoying such a feast, as Apicius, who sailed to Africa from
      Rome to eat good oysters, would gladly have voyaged from Rome to Ireland
      to have partaken of; for they were absolutely dining on an immense turbot
      (whose fellow-sufferers were floundering in a boat that lay anchored near
      the door.) A most cordial invitation on their part, and a most willing
      compliance on mine, was the ceremony of a moment; and never did an English
      alderman on turtle day, or Roman emperor on lampreys and peacocks&rsquo; livers,
      make a more delicious repast, than the chance guest of these good people,
      on their boiled turbot and roasted potatoes, which was quaffed down by the
      pure phalernian of a neighbouring spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having learnt that the son was going with the compeers of the demolished
      turbot to Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
    </p>
    <p>
      I took out my little escritoire to write you an account of the first
      adventure of my chivalrous tour; while one of spring&rsquo;s most grateful sunny
      show ers, is pattering on the leaves of the only tree that shades this
      simple dwelling, and my <i>Rosinante</i> is nibbling a scanty dinner from
      the patches of vegetation that sprinkle the surrounding cliffs. Adieu! the
      vesper hour arrives. In all &ldquo;my orisons thy sins shall be remembered.&rdquo; The
      spirit of adventure wholly possesses me, and on the dusky horizon of life,
      some little glimmering of light begins to dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encore adieu.

      <i>Castle of Inismore, Barony of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>y, &lsquo;tis even so&mdash;point
      your glasses&mdash;and rub your eyes, &lsquo;tis all one; here I am, and here I
      am likely to remain for some time, but whether a prisoner of war, taken up
      on a suspicion of espionage, or to be offered as an appeasing sacrifice to
      the <i>manes</i> of the old Prince of Inismore, you must for a while
      suspend your patience to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the <i>carte du pays</i> laid out for me by the fisherman, I
      left the shore and crossed the summit of a mountain that &ldquo;battled o&rsquo;er the
      deep,&rdquo; and which after an hour&rsquo;s ascension, I found sloped almost
      perpendicularly down to a bold and rocky coast, its base terminating in a
      peninsula, that advanced for near half a mile into the ocean. Towards the
      extreme western point of this peninsula, which was wildly romantic beyond
      all description, arose a vast and grotesque pile of rocks, which at once
      formed the site and fortifications of the noblest mass of ruins on which
      my eye ever rested. Grand even in desolation, and magnificent in decay&mdash;it
      was the Castle of Inismore. The setting sun shone brightly on its
      mouldering turrets, and the waves which bathed its rocky basis, reflected
      on their swelling bosoms the dark outlines of its awful ruins. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Those who have visited the Castle of Dunluce, near the
     Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, may, perhaps, have some idea of its
     striking features in this rude draught of the Castle of
     Inismore.
</pre>
    <p>
      As I descended the mountain&rsquo;s brow I observed that the little isthmus
      which joined the peninsula to the main land had been cut away, and a
      curious danger-threatening bridge was rudely thrown across the intervening
      gulf, flung from the rocks on one side to an angle of the mountain on the
      other, leaving a yawning chasm of some fathoms deep beneath the foot of
      the wary passenger. This must have been a very perilous pass in the days
      of civil warfare; and in the intrepidity of my daring ancestor, I almost
      forgot his crime. Amidst the interstices of the rocks which skirted the
      shores of this interesting peninsula, patches of the richest vegetation
      were to be seen, and the trees which sprung wildly among its venerable
      ruins, were bursting into all the vernal luxuriancy of spring. In the
      course of my descent, several cabins of a better description than I had
      yet seen, appeared scattered beneath the shelter of the mountain&rsquo;s
      innumerable projections; while in the air and dress of the inhabitants
      (which the sound of my horse&rsquo;s feet brought to their respective doors,) I
      evidently perceived a something original and primitive, I had never
      noticed before in this class of persons here.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appeared to me, I know not why, to be in their holiday garb, and
      their dress, though grotesque and coarse, was cleanly and characteristic.
      I observed that round the heads of the elderly dames were folded several
      wreaths of white or coloured linen, * and others had hand kerchiefs **
      lightly folded round their brows, and curiously fastened under the chin;
      while the young wore their hair fastened up with wooden bodkins. They were
      all enveloped in large shapeless mantles of blue frieze, and most of them
      had a rosary hanging on their arm, from whence I inferred they were on the
      point of attending vespers at the chapel of Inismore.
    </p>

     * &ldquo;The women&rsquo;s ancient headdress so perfectly resembles that
     of the Egyptian Isis, that it cannot be doubted but that the
     modes of Egypt were preserved among the Irish.&rdquo;&mdash;Walker on
     the Ancient Irish dress, p. 62.

     **  These handkerchiefs they call &ldquo;Binnogues,&rdquo; it is a remnant
     of a very ancient mode.
</pre>
    <p>
      I alighted at the door of a cabin a few paces distant from the Alpine
      bridge, and entreated a shed for my horse, while I performed my devotions.
      The man to whom I addressed myself, seemed the only one of several who
      surrounded me that understood English, and appeared much edified by my
      pious intention, saying, &ldquo;that God would prosper my Honour&rsquo;s journey, and
      that I was welcome to a shed for my horse, and a night&rsquo;s lodging for
      myself into the bargain.&rdquo; He then offered to be my guide, and as we
      crossed the drawbridge, he told me I was out of luck by not coming
      earlier, for that high mass had been celebrated that morning for the
      repose of the soul of a Prince of Inismore, who had been murdered on this
      very day of the month. &ldquo;And when this day comes round,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we all
      attend dressed in our best; for my part, I never wear my poor old
      grandfather&rsquo;s <i>berrad</i> but on the like occasion,&rdquo; taking off a
      curious cap of a conical form, which he twirled round his hand and
      regarded with much satisfaction. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A few years back, Hugh Dugan, a peasant of the county of
     Kilkenny, who affected the ancient Irish dress, seldom
     appeared without his berrad.
</pre>
    <p>
      By heavens! as I breathed this region of superstition, so strongly was I
      infected, that my usual scepticism was scarcely proof against my
      inclination to mount my horse and gallop off, as I shudderingly
      pronounced, &ldquo;I am then entering the castle of Inismore on the anniversary
      of that day on which my ancestors took the life of its venerable Prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You see, my good friend, how much we are the creatures of situation and
      circumstance, and with what pliant servility the mind resigns itself to
      the impressions of the senses, or the illusions of the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now reached the ruined cloisters of the chapel, I paused to examine
      their curious but dilapidated architecture when my guide, hurrying me on,
      said, &ldquo;if I did not quicken my pace, I should miss getting a good view of
      the Prince,&rdquo; who was just entering by a door opposite to that we had
      passed through. Behold me then mingling among a group of peasantry, and,
      like them, straining my eyes to that magnet which fascinated every glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And sure, fancy, in her boldest flight, never gave to the fairy vision of
      poetic dreams, a combination of images more poetically fine, more
      strikingly picturesque, or more impressively touching. Nearly one half of
      the chapel of Inismore has fallen into decay, and the ocean breeze as it
      rushed through the fractured roof, wafted the torn banners of the family
      which hung along its dismantled walls. The red beams of the sinking sun
      shone on the glittering tabernacle which stood on the altar, and touched
      with their golden light the sacerdotal vestments of the two officiating
      priests, who ascended its broken steps at the moment that the Prince and
      his family entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of this most singular and interesting group, was the venerable
      Father John, the chaplain. Religious enthusiasm never gave to the fancied
      form of the first of the patriarchs, a countenance of more holy expression
      or divine resignation; a figure more touching by its dignified simplicity,
      or an air more beneficently mild, more meekly good. He was dressed in his
      pontificals, and, with his eyes bent to the earth, his hands spread upon
      his breast, he joined his coadjutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast to this saintly being now struck my view; a form almost
      gigantic in stature, yet gently thrown forward by evident infirmity; limbs
      of herculean mould, and a countenance rather furrowed by the inroads of
      vehement passions, than the deep trace of years. Eyes still emanating the
      ferocity of an unsubdued spirit, yet tempered by a strong trait of
      benevolence; which, like a glory, irradiated a broad expansive brow, a
      mouth on which even yet the spirit of convivial enjoyment seemed to hover,
      though shaded by two large whiskers on the upper lip, * which still
      preserved their ebon hue; while time or grief had bleached the scattered
      hairs which hung their snows upon the manly temple. The drapery which
      covered this striking figure was singularly appropriate, and, as I have
      since been told, strictly conformable to the ancient costume of the Irish
      nobles.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;I have been confidently assured, that the granfather of
     the present Rt. Hon. John O&rsquo;Neal, (great grandfather to the
     present Lord O&rsquo;Neal) the elegant and accomplished owner of
     Shane&rsquo;s Castle, wore his beard after the prohibited Irish
     mode.&rdquo;&mdash;Walker, p. 62.
</pre>
    <p>
      The only part of the under garment visible, was the ancient Irish <i>truis</i>,
      which closely adhering to the limbs from the waist to the ancle, includes
      the pantaloon and hose, and terminates in a buskin not dissimilar to the
      Roman <i>perones</i>. A triangular mantle of bright scarlet cloth,
      embroidered and fringed round the edges, fell from his shoulders to the
      ground, and was fastened at the breast with a large circular golden
      brooch, of a workmanship most curiously beautiful; round his neck hung a
      golden collar, which seemed to denote the wearer of some order of
      knighthood, probably hereditary in his family; a dagger, called a <i>skiene</i>
      (for my guide explained every article of the dress to me,) was sheathed in
      his girdle, and was discerned by the sunbeam that played on its brilliant
      haft. And as he entered the chapel, he removed from his venerable head a
      cap or berrad, of the same form as that I had noticed with my guide, but
      made of velvet, richly embroidered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chieftain moved with dignity&mdash;yet with difficulty&mdash;and his
      colossal, but infirm frame, seemed to claim support from a form so almost
      impalpably delicate, that as it floated on the gaze, it seemed like the
      incarnation of some pure ethereal spirit, which a sigh, too roughly
      breathed, would dissolve into its kindred air; yet to this sylphid
      elegance of spheral beauty was united all that symmetrical <i>contour</i>
      which constitutes the luxury of human loveliness. This scarcely &ldquo;mortal
      mixture of earth&rsquo;s mould,&rdquo; was vested in a robe of vestal white, which was
      enfolded beneath the bosom with a narrow girdle embossed with precious
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the shoulder fell a mantle of scarlet silk, fastened at the neck with
      a silver bodkin, while the fine turned head was enveloped in a veil of
      point lace, bound round the brow with a band or diadem, ornamented with
      the same description of jewels as encircled her arms. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This was, with a little variation, the general costume of
     the female noblesse of Ireland from a very early period. In
     the fifteenth century the veil was very prevalent, and was
     termed fillag, or scarf; the Irish ladies, like those of
     ancient and modern Greece, seldom appearing. As the veil
     made no part of the Celtic costume, its origin was probably
     merely oriental.

     The great love of ornaments betrayed by the Irish ladies of
     other times, &ldquo;the beauties of the heroes of old,&rdquo; art thus
     described by a quaint and ancient author:&mdash;&ldquo;Their necks are
     hung with chains and carkanets&mdash;their arms wreathed with
     many bracelets.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Such was the <i>figure</i> of the Princess of Inis-more! But oh! not once
      was the face turned round towards that side where I stood. And when I
      shifted my position, the envious veil intercepted the ardent glance which
      eagerly sought the fancied charms it concealed: for was it possible to
      doubt the face would not &ldquo;keep the promise that the form had made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The group that followed was grotesque beyond all powers of description.
      The ancient bard, whose long white beard
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Descending, swept his aged breast,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      the incongruous costume&mdash;half modern, half antique, of the bare
      footed domestics, the ostensible steward, who closed the procession&mdash;and
      above all, the dignified importance of the <i>nurse</i>, who took the lead
      in it immediately after her young lady; her air, form, countenance, and
      dress, were indeed so singularly fantastic and <i>outre</i>, that the
      genius of masquerade might have adopted her figure as the finest model of
      grotesque caricature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive for a moment a form whose longitude bore no degree of proportion
      to her latitude; dressed in a short jacket of brown cloth, with loose
      sleeves from the elbow to the wrist, made of red camblet striped with
      green, and turned up with a broad cuff&mdash;a petticoat of scarlet
      frieze, covered by an apron of green serge, longitudinally striped with
      scarlet tape, and sufficiently short to betray an ancle that sanctioned
      all the libels ever uttered against the ancles of the Irish fair&mdash;true
      national brogues set off her blue worsted stockings, and her yellow hair,
      dragged over a high roll, was covered on the summit with a little coiff,
      over which was flung a scarlet handkerchief, which fastened in a large bow
      under her rubicund chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this singular and interesting group advanced up the central aisle of
      the chapel, reverence and affection were evidently blended in the looks of
      the multitude which hung upon their steps; and though the Prince and his
      daughter seeked to lose in the meekness of true religion all sense of
      temporal inequality, and promiscuously mingled with the congregation, yet
      that distinction they humbly avoided, was reverently forced on them by the
      affectionate crowd, which drew back on either side as they advanced, until
      the chieftain and his child stood alone in the centre of the ruined choir,
      the winds of heaven playing freely amidst their garments, the sun&rsquo;s
      setting beam enriching their beautiful figures with its orient tints,
      while he, like Milton&rsquo;s ruined angel,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;Above the rest,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In shape and feature proudly eminent,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Stood like a tower;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and she, like the personified spirit of Mercy hovered round him, or
      supported more by tenderness than her strength, him from whom she could no
      longer claim support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those gray headed domestics, too, those faith ful though but nominal
      vassals, who offered that voluntary reverence with their looks, which his
      repaid with fatherly affection, while the anguish of a suffering heart
      hung on his pensive smile, sustained by the firmness of that indignant
      pride which lowered on his ample brow!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a picture!
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the first flush of interest, curiosity, and amazement had
      subsided, my attention was carried towards the altar; and then I thought
      as I watched the impressive avocation of Father John, that had I been the
      Prince, I would have been the <i>Caiphas</i> too.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a religion is this! How finely does it harmonize with the weakness of
      our nature, how seducingly it speaks to the senses; how forcibly it works
      on the passions; how strongly it seizes on the imagination; how
      interesting its forms; how graceful its ceremonies; how awful its rites.
      What a captivating, what a <i>picturesque</i> faith! Who would not become
      its proselyte, were it not for the stern opposition of reason, the cold
      suggestions of philosophy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The last strain of the vesper hymn died on the air as the sun&rsquo;s last beam
      faded on the casements of the chapel; and the Prince and his daughter., to
      avoid the intrusion of the crowd, withdrew through a private door, which
      communicated by a ruinous arcade with the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was the first to leave the chapel, and followed them at a distance as
      they moved slowly along, their fine figures, sometimes concealed behind a
      pillar, and again emerging from the transient shade, flushed with the deep
      suffusion of the crimsoned firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once they paused, as if to admire the beautiful effect of the retreating
      light, as it faded on the ocean&rsquo;s swelling bosom; and once the Princess
      raised her hand and pointed to the evening star, which rose brilliantly on
      the deep cerulean blue of a cloudless atmosphere, and shed its fairy beam
      on the mossy summit of a mouldering turret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the sublime objects which seemed to engage their attention, and
      added their <i>sensible</i> inspiration to the fervour of those more
      abstracted devotions in which they were so recently engaged. At last they
      reached the portals of the castle, and I lost sight of them. Yet still
      spellbound, I stood transfixed to the spot from whence I had caught a last
      view of their receding figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I felt like the victim of superstitious terror when the spectre of
      its distempered fancy vanishes from its strained and eager gaze, all I had
      lately seen revolved in my mind like some pictured story of romantic
      fiction. I cast round my eyes; all still seemed the vision of awakened
      imagination. Surrounded by a scenery grand even to the boldest majesty of
      nature, and wild even to desolation&mdash;the day&rsquo;s dying splendours
      Awfully involving in the gloomy haze of deepening twilight&mdash;the gray
      mists of stealing night gathering on the still faintly illumined surface
      of the ocean, which, awfully spreading to infinitude, seemed to the
      limited gaze of human vision to incorporate with the heaven whose last
      glow it reflected&mdash;the rocks, which on every side rose to Alpine
      elevation, exhibiting, amidst the soft obscurity, forms savagely bold or
      grotesquely wild; and those finely interesting ruins which spread grandly
      desolate in the rear, and added a moral interest to the emotions excited
      by this view of nature in her most awful, most touching aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus suddenly withdrawn from the world&rsquo;s busiest haunts, its hackneyed
      modes, its vicious pursuits, and unimportant avocations&mdash;dropped as
      it were amidst scenes and mysterious sublimity&mdash;alone&mdash;on the
      wildest shores of the greatest ocean of the universe; immersed amidst the
      decaying monuments of past ages; still viewing in recollection such forms,
      such manners, such habits (as I had lately beheld,) which to the worldly
      mind may be well supposed to belong to a race long passed beyond the
      barrier of existence, with &ldquo;the years beyond the flood,&rdquo; I felt like the
      being of some other sphere newly alighted on a distant orb. While the
      novel train of thought which stole on my mind, seemed to seize its tone
      from the awful tranquillity by which I was surrounded, and I remained
      leaning on the fragment of a rock, as the waves dashed idly against its
      base, until their dark heads were silvered by the rising moon, and while
      my eyes dwelt on her silent progress, the castle clock struck nine. Thus
      warned, I arose to depart, yet not without reluctance. My soul, for the
      first time, had here held commune with herself; the &ldquo;lying vanities&rdquo; of
      life no longer intoxicating my senses, appeared to me for the first time
      in their genuine aspect, and my heart still fondly loitered over those
      scenes of solemn interest, where some of its best feelings had been called
      into existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly departing, I raised my eyes to the Castle of Inismore and sighed,
      and almost wished I had been born the Lord of these beautiful ruins, the
      Prince of this isolated little territory, and adored chieftain of these
      affectionate and natural people. At that moment a strain of music stole by
      me, as if the breeze of midnight stillness had expired in a manner on the
      Eolian lyre. Emotion, undefinable emotion, thrilled on every nerve. I
      listened. I trembled. A breathless silence gave me every note. Was it the
      illusion of my now all-awakened fancy, or the professional exertions of
      the bard of Inismore? Oh, no! for the voice it symphonized, the low, wild,
      tremulous voice which sweetly sighed its soul of melody o&rsquo;er the harp&rsquo;s
      responsive chords, was the voice of <i>a woman!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Directed by the witching strain, I approached an angle of the building
      from whence it seemed to proceed; and perceiving a light which streamed
      through an open casement, I climbed with some difficulty the ruins of a
      parapet wall which encircled this wing of the castle, and which rose so
      immediately under the casement as to give me, when I stood on it, a
      perfect view of the interior of that apartment to which it belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two tapers, which burned on a marble slab at the remotest extremity of
      this vast and gloomy chamber, shed their dim blue light on the saintly
      countenance of Father John, who, with a large folio open before him,
      seemed wholly wrapped in studious meditation; while the Prince, reclined
      on an immense Gothic couch, with his robe thrown over the arm that
      supported his head, betrayed by the expression of his countenance those
      emotions, which agitated his soul, while he listened to those strains
      which spoke at once to the heart of the father, the patriot, and the man&mdash;breathed
      from the chords of his country&rsquo;s emblem&mdash;breathed in the pathos of
      his country&rsquo;s music&mdash;breathed from the lips of his apparently
      inspired daughter! The white rising of her hands upon the harp the
      half-drawn veil that imperfectly discovered the countenance of a seraph;
      the moonlight that played round her fine form, and partially touched her
      drapery with its silver beam&mdash;her attitude! her air! But how cold&mdash;how
      inanimate&mdash;how imperfect this description! Oh! could I but seize the
      touching features&mdash;could I but realize the vivid tints of this
      enchanting picture, as they then glowed on my fancy! By heavens! you would
      think the mimic copy fabulous; &ldquo;the celestial visitant&rdquo; of an overheated
      imagination. Yet, as if the independent witchery of the lovely minstrel
      was not in itself all, all-sufficient, at the back of her chair stood the
      grotesque figure of her antiquated nurse. O! the precious contrast. And
      yet it heightened, it finished the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus entranced in breathless observation, endeavouring to support my
      precarious tenement, and to prolong this rich feast of the senses and the
      soul, the loose stones on which I tottered gave way under my feet, and
      impulsively clinging to the wood work of the casement, it mouldered in my
      grasp. I fell&mdash;but before I reached the earth I was bereft of sense.
      With its return I found myself in a large apartment, stretched on a bed,
      and supported in the arms of the Prince of Inismore! his hand was pressed
      to my bleeding temple, while the priest applied a styptic to the wound it
      had received; and the nurse was engaged in binding up my arm, which had
      been dreadfully bruised and fractured a little above the wrist. Some
      domestics, with an air of mingled concern and curiosity, surrounded my
      couch; and at her father&rsquo;s side stood the Lady Glorvina, her looks pale
      and disordered&mdash;her trembling hands busily employed in preparing
      bandages, for which my skilful doctress impatiently called.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my mind almost doubted the evidence of my senses, and a physical
      conviction alone <i>painfully</i> proved to me the reality of all I
      beheld, my wandering, wondering eyes met those of the Prince of Inismore!
      A volume of pity and benevolence was registered in their glance; nor were
      mine, I suppose, inexpressive of my feelings, for he thus replied to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of good cheer, young stranger; you are in no danger; be composed; be
      confident; conceive yourself in the midst of friends; for you are
      surrounded by those who would wish to be considered as such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I attempted to speak, but my voice faltered; my tongue was nerveless; my
      mouth dry and parched. A trembling hand presented a cordial to my lips. I
      quaffed the philtre, and fixed my eyes on the face of my ministering
      angel. That angel was Glorvina! I closed them, and sunk on the bosom of
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he faints again!&rdquo; cried a sweet and plaintive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;the weariness of acute pain
      something subsided, is lulling him into a soft repose; for see, the colour
      reanimates his cheek, and his pulse quickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It indeed beats most wildly,&rdquo; returned the sweet physician; for the pulse
      which responded to her finger&rsquo;s thrilling pressure moved with no languid
      throb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us retire,&rdquo; added the priest, &ldquo;all danger is now, thank heaven, over;
      and repose and quiet the most salutary requisites for our patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words he arose from my bedside, and the Prince, gently
      withdrawing his supporting arms, laid my head upon the pillow. In a moment
      all was deathlike stillness, and stealing a glance from under my half
      closed eyes, I found myself alone with my skilful doctress, the nurse,
      who, shading the taper&rsquo;s light from the bed, had taken her distaff and
      seated herself on a stool at some distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a golden respite to feelings wound up to that vehement excess
      which forbade all expression, which left my tongue powerless, while my
      heart overflowed with emotion the most powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God! I, the son of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the hereditary
      object of hereditary detestation, beneath the roof of my implacable enemy!
      Supported in his arms; relieved from anguish by his charitable attention;
      honoured by the solicitude of his lovely daughter; overwhelmed by the
      charitable exertions of his whole family; and reduced to that bodily
      infirmity that would of necessity oblige me to continue for some time the
      object of their beneficent attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a series of emotions did this conviction awaken in my heart! Emotions
      of a character, an energy, long unknown to my apathized feelings; while
      gratitude to those who had drawn them into existence, combined with the
      interest, the curiosity, the admiration they had awakened, tended to
      confirm my irresistible desire of perpetuating the immunities I enjoyed,
      as the guest and patient of the Prince and his daughter. And, while the
      touch of this Wild Irish Girl&rsquo;s hand thrilled on every sense, while her
      voice of tenderest pity murmured on my ear, and I secretly triumphed over
      the prejudices of her father, I would not have exchanged my broken arm and
      wounded temple for the strongest limb and soundest head in the kingdom;
      but the same chance which threw me in the supporting arms of the irascible
      Prince, might betray to him in the person of his patient, the son of his
      hereditary enemy: it was at least probable he would make some inquiries
      relative to the object of his benevolence, and the singular cause which
      rendered him such; it was therefore a necessary policy in me to be
      provided against this scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already deep in adventure, a thousand seducing reasons were suggested by
      my newly-awakened heart to go on with the romance, and to secure for my
      farther residence in the castle, that interest, which, if known to be the
      son of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, I must eventually have
      forfeited, for the cold version of irreclaimable prejudice. The imposition
      was at least innocent, and might tend to future and mutual advantage; and
      after the ideal assumption of a thousand fictitious characters, I at last
      fixed on that of an itinerant artist, as consonant to my most cultivated
      talent, and to the testimony of those witnesses which I had fortunately
      brought with me, namely my drawing-book, pencils, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
      self-nominated <i>Henry Mortimer</i>, to answer the initials on my linen,
      the only proofs against me, for I had not even a letter with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was now armed at all points for inspection; and as the Prince lived in a
      perfect state of isolation, and I was unknown in the country, I
      entertained no apprehensions of discovery during the time I should remain
      at the castle; and full of hope, strong in confidence, but wearied by
      incessant cogitation, and something exhausted by pain, I fell into that
      profound slumber I did before but feign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mid-day beams shone brightly through the faded tints of my bed
      curtains before I awakened the following morning, after a night of such
      fairy charms as only float round the couch of
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Fancy trained in bliss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, and the two other domestics, relieved the watch at my bedside
      during the night; and when I drew back the curtain, the former
      complimented me on my somniferous powers, and in the usual mode of
      inquiry, but in a very unusual accent and dialect, addressed me with much
      kindness and goodnatured solicitude. While I was endeavouring to express
      my gratitude for her attentions, and, what seemed most acceptable to her,
      my high opinion of her skill, the Father Director entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the benevolent mind, distress or misfortune is ever a sufficient claim
      on all the privileges of intimacy; and when Father John seated himself by
      my bedside, affectionately took my hand, lamented my accident, and assured
      me of my improved looks, it was with an air so kindly familiar, so
      tenderly intimate, that it was impossible to suspect the sound of his
      voice was yet a stranger to my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prepared and collected, as soon as I had expressed my sense of his and the
      Prince&rsquo;s benevolence, I briefly related my feigned story; and in a few
      minutes I was a young Englishman, by birth a gentleman, by inevitable
      misfortunes reduced to a dependence on my talents for a livelihood, and by
      profession an artist. I added, that I came to Ireland to take views, and
      seize some of the finest features of its landscapes; that, having heard
      much of the wildly picturesque charms of the northwest coasts, I had
      penetrated thus far into this remote corner of the province of Connaught;
      that the uncommon beauty of the views surrounding the castle, and the
      awful magnificence of its ruins, had arrested my wanderings, and
      determined me to spend some days in its vicinity; that, having attended
      divine service the preceding evening in the chapel, I continued to wander
      along the romantic shores of Inismore, and, in the adventuring spirit of
      my art, had climbed part of the mouldering ruins of the castle to catch a
      fine effect of light and shade, produced by the partially veiled beams of
      the moon, and had then met with the accident which now threw me on the
      benevolence of the Prince of Innisinore; an unknown, in a strange country,
      with a fractured limb, a wounded head, and a heart oppressed with the
      sense of gratitude under which it laboured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you were a stranger and a traveller, who had been led by curiosity
      or devotion to visit the chapel of Inismore,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;we were
      already apprised of, by the peasant who brought to the castle last night
      the horse and valise left at his cabin, and who feared, from the length of
      your absence, some accident had befallen you. What you have yourself been
      kind enough to detail, is precisely what will prove your best letter of
      recommendation to the Prince. Trust me, young gentleman, that your
      standing in need of his attention is the best claim you could make on it;
      and your admiration of his native scenes, of that ancient edifice, the
      monument of that decayed ancestral splendour still dear to his pride; and
      your having so severely suffered through an anxiety by which he must be
      flattered, will induce him to consider himself as even <i>bound</i> to
      administer every attention that can meliorate the unpleasantness of your
      present situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What an idea did this give me of the character of him whose heart I once
      believed divested of all the tender feelings of humanity. Everything that
      mine could dictate on the subject I endeavoured to express, and, borne
      away by the vehemence of my feelings, did it in a manner that more than
      once fastened the eyes of Father John on my face, with that look of
      surprise and admiration which, to a delicate mind, is more gratifying than
      the most finished verbal eulogium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stimulated by this silent approbation, I insensibly stole the conversation
      from myself to a more general theme: one thought was the link to an-other&mdash;the
      chain of discussion gradually extended, and before the nurse brought up my
      breakfast we had ranged through the whole circle of <i>sciences</i>. I
      found that this intelligent and amiable being had trifled a good deal in
      his young days with chemistry, of which he still spoke like a lover who,
      in maturer life, fondly dwells on the charms of that object who first
      awakened the youthful raptures of his heart. He is even still an
      enthusiast in botany, and as free from monastic pedantry as he is rich in
      the treasures of classical literature and the elegancies of belles
      lettres. His feelings even yet preserve something of the ardour of youth,
      and in his mild character evidently appears blended a philosophical
      knowledge of human nature, with the most perfect worldly inexperience, and
      the manly intelligence of a highly gifted mind, with the sentiments of a
      recluse and the simplicity of a child. His still ardent mind seemed to
      dilate to the correspondence of a kindred intellect, and two hours&rsquo;
      bedside chit chat, with all the unrestrained freedom such a situation
      sanctions, produced a more perfect intimacy than an age would probably
      have effected under different circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having examined and dressed the wounded temple, which he declared to
      be a mere scratch, and congratulated me on the apparent convalescence of
      my looks, he withdrew, politely excusing the length of his visit by
      pleading the charms of my conversation as the cause of his detention.
      There is, indeed, an evident vein of French suavity flowing through his
      manners, that convinced me he had spent some years of his life in that
      region of the graces. I have since learned that he was partly educated in
      France; so that, to my astonishment, I have discovered the manners of a
      gentleman, the conversation of a scholar, and the sentiment of a
      philanthropist, united in the character of an Irish priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my heart throbbed with the natural satisfaction arising from the
      consciousness of having awakened an interest in those whom it was my
      ambition to interest, my female Esculapius came and seated herself by me;
      and while she talked of fevers, inflammations, and the Lord knows what,
      insisted on my not speaking another word for the rest of the day. Though
      by no means appearing to labour under the same Pythagorean restraint she
      had imposed on me; and after having extolled her own surgical powers, her
      celebrity as the best bone-setter in the barony, and communicated the long
      list of patients her skill had saved, her tongue at last rested on the
      only theme I was inclined to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah! now, jewel,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;there is our Lady Glorvina now, who
      with all her skill, and knowing every leaf that grows, why she could no
      more set your arm than she could break it. Och! it was herself that turned
      white when she saw the blood upon your face, for she was the first to hear
      you fall, and hasten down to have you picked up; at first, faith, we
      thought you were a robber; but it was all one to her, into the castle you
      must be brought, and when she saw the blood spout from your temple, Holy
      Virgin! she looked for all the world as if she was kilt dead herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is she,&rdquo; said I, in the selfishness of my heart, &ldquo;is she always thus
      humanely interested for the unfortunate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! it is she that is tender hearted for man or beast,&rdquo; replied my
      companion. &ldquo;I shall never forget till the day of my death, <i>nor then</i>
      either, faith, the day that Kitty Mulrooney&rsquo;s cow was bogged: you must
      know, honey, that a bogged cow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, however, the episode of Kitty Mulrooney&rsquo;s cow was cut
      short, for the Prince now entered, leaning on the arm of the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dull indeed must be every feeling, and blunted every recollective faculty,
      when the look, the air, the smile with which this venerable and benevolent
      chieftain, approaching my bed, and kindly taking me by the hand, addressed
      me in the singular idiom of his expressive language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the stranger&rsquo;s best gift is upon you, for the eye
      that sees you for the first time, wishes it may not be the last; and the
      ear that drinks your words, grows thirsty as it quaffs them. So says our
      good Father John here, for you have made him your friend ere you are his
      acquaintance; and as the <i>friend of my friend</i>, my heart opens to
      you; you are welcome to my house as long as it is pleasant to you; when it
      ceases to be so, we will part with you with regret, and speed your journey
      with our wishes and our prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could my heart have lent its eloquence to my lip&mdash;but that was
      impossible; very imperfect indeed was the justice I did to my feelings;
      but as my peroration was a eulogium on these romantic scenes and
      interesting ruins, the contemplation of which I had nearly purchased with
      my life, the Prince seemed as much pleased as if my gratitude had poured
      forth with <i>Ciceronean</i> eloquence, and he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When your health will permit, you can pursue here uninterrupted your
      charming art. Once the domains of Inismore could have supplied the
      painter&rsquo;s pencil with scenes of smiling felicity, and the song of the bard&mdash;with
      many a theme of joy and triumph; but the harp can only mourn over the
      fallen greatness of its sons; and the pencil has nothing left to delineate
      but the ruins which shelter the gray head of the last of their
      descendants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were pronounced with an emotion that shook the dilapidated
      frame of the Prince, and the tear which dimmed the spirit of his eye,
      formed an associate in that of his auditor. He gazed on me for a moment
      with a look that seemed to say, &ldquo;you feel for me, then&mdash;yet you are
      an Englishman and taking the arm of Father John, he walked towards a
      window which commanded a view of the ocean, whose troubled bosom beat
      wildly against the castle cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day is sad,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and makes the soul gloomy: we will summon
      O&rsquo;Gallagher to the hall, and drive away sorrow with music.&rdquo; Then turning
      to me, he added, with a faint smile &ldquo;the tones of the Irish harp have
      still the power to breathe a spirit over the drooping soul of an Irishman;
      but if its strains disturb your repose, command its silence: the pleasure
      of the host always rests in that of his guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and leaning on the arm of his chaplain, he retired;
      while the nurse, looking affectionately after him, raised her hands and
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! there you go, and may the blessing of the Holy Virgin go with you,
      for it&rsquo;s yourself that&rsquo;s the jewel of a Prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impression made on me by this brief but interesting interview, is not
      to be expressed. You should see the figure, the countenance, the dress of
      the Prince; the appropriate scenery of the old Gothic chamber, the
      characteristic appearance of the priest and the nurse, to understand the
      combined and forcible effect the whole produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though experiencing a pleasurable emotion, strong as it was novel,
      there was still one little wakeful wish throbbing vaguely at my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that my chilled, my sated misanthropic feelings, still
      sent forth one sigh of wishful solicitude for woman&rsquo;s dangerous presence?
      No, the sentiment the daughter of the Prince inspired, only made a <i>part</i>
      in that general feeling of curiosity, which every thing in this new region
      of wonders continued to nourish into existence. What had I to expect from
      the unpolished manners, the confined ideas of this Wild Irish Girl?
      Deprived of all those touching allurements which society only gives;
      reared in wilds and solitudes, with no other associates than her nurse,
      her confessor, and her father; endowed indeed by nature with some personal
      gifts, set off by the advantage of a singular and characteristic dress,
      for which she is indebted to whim and natural prejudice, rather than
      native taste:&mdash;I, who had fled in disgust even from those to whose
      natural attraction the bewitching blandishments of education, the
      brilliant polish of fashion, and the dazzling splendour of <i>real</i>
      rank, contributed their potent spells.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, the roses of Florida, though the fair est in the universe, and
      springing from the richest soil, emit no fragrance; while the mountain
      violet, rearing its timid form from a steril bed, flings on the morning
      breeze the most delicious perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      While given up to such reflections as these&mdash;while the sound of the
      Irish harp arose from the hall below, and the nurse muttered her prayers
      in Irish over her beads by my side, I fell into a gentle slumber, in which
      I dreamed that the Princess of Inismore approached my bed, drew aside the
      curtains, and raising her veil, discovered a face I had hitherto rather
      guessed at than seen. Imagine my horror&mdash;it was the face, the head of
      a <i>Gorgon!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Awakened by the sudden and terrific emotion it excited, though still
      almost motionless, as if from the effects of a nightmare (which in fact,
      from the position I lay in, had oppressed me in the form of the Princess)
      I cast my eyes through a fracture in the old damask drapery of my bed, and
      beheld&mdash;not the horrid spectre of my recent dream, but the form of a
      cherub hovering near my pillow&mdash;it was the Lady Glorvina herself! Oh!
      how I trembled lest the fair image should only be the vision of my
      slumber: I scarcely dared to breathe, lest it should dissolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated on the nurse&rsquo;s little stool, her elbow resting on her knee,
      her cheek reclined upon her hand: for once the wish of Romeo appeared no
      hyperbela.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some snowdrops lay scattered in her lap, on which her downcast eyes shed
      their beams; as though she moralized over the modest blossoms, which, in
      fate a delecacy, resembled herself. Changing her pensive attitude, she
      collected them into a bunch, and sighed, and waved her head as she gazed
      on them. The dew that trembled on their leaves seemed to have flowed from
      a richer source than the exhalation of the morning&rsquo;s vapour&mdash;for the
      flowers are faded&mdash;-but the drops that gem&rsquo;d them are fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the possession of a little kingdom would have been less
      desirable to me, than the knowledge of that association of ideas and
      feelings which the contemplation of these honoured flowers awakened. At
      last, with a tender smile, she raised them to her lip and sighed, and
      placed them in her bosom; then softly drew aside my curtain. I feigned the
      stillness of death&mdash;yet the curtain remained unclosed&mdash;many
      minutes elapsed&mdash;I ventured to unseal my eyes, and met the soul
      dissolving glance of my sweet attendant spirit, who seemed to gaze
      intently on her charge. Emotion on my part the most delicious, on hers the
      most modestly confused, for a moment prevented all presence of mind; the
      beautiful arm still supported the curtain&mdash;my ardent gaze was still
      riveted on a face alternately suffused with the electric flashes of red
      and white. At last the curtain fell, the priest entered, and the vision,
      the sweetest, brightest vision of my life, dissolved!
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina sprung towards her tutor, and told him aloud, that the nurse had
      entreated her to take her place, while she descended to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no place can become thee better, my child,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;than
      that which fixes thee by the couch of suffering and sickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said Glorvina, smiling, &ldquo;I will gratify you by resigning for
      the present in your favour,&rdquo; and away she flew speaking in Irish to the
      nurse, who passed her at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benevolent confessor then approached, and seated himself beside my
      bed, with that premeditated air of chit-chat sociality, that it went to my
      soul to disappoint him. But the thing was impossible, to have tamely
      conversed in mortal language on mortal subjects, after having held &ldquo;high
      communion&rdquo; with an etherial spirit; when a sigh, a tear, a glance, were
      the delicious vehicles of our souls&rsquo; secret intercourse&mdash;to stoop
      from this &ldquo;colloquy sublime!&rdquo; I could as soon have delivered a logical
      essay on identity and adversity, or any other subject equally interesting
      to the heart and imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore closed my eyes, and breathed most sonorously: the good priest
      drew the curtain and retired on tip-toe, and the nurse once more took her
      distaff, and, for her sins, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      These good people must certainly think me a second Epimenides, for I have
      done nothing but sleep, or feign to sleep, since I have been thrown
      amongst them.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> have already
      passed four days beneath this hospitable roof. On the third, a slight
      fever with which I had been threatened passed off, my head was
      disincumbered, and on the fourth I was able to leave my bed, and to
      scribble thus far of my journal. Yet these kind solicitous beings will not
      suffer me to leave my room, and still the nurse at intervals gives me the
      pleasure of her society, and hums old <i>cronans</i>, or amuses me with
      what she calls a little <i>shanaos</i>, * as she plies her distaff; while
      the priest frequently indulges me with his interesting and intelligent
      conversation. The good man is a great logician, and fond of displaying his
      metaphysical prowess, where he feels that he is understood, and we
      diurnally go over <i>infinity, space</i>, and <i>duration</i>, with
      innate, simple, and complex idea, until our own are exhausted in the
      discussion; and then we generally relax with Ovid, or trifle with Horace
      and Tibullus, for nothing can be less austerely pious than this cheerful
      gentle being: nothing can be more innocent than his life; nothing more
      liberal than his sentiments.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A term in very general use in Ireland, and is applied to a
     kind of genealogical chit chat, or talking over family
     antiquity, family anecdotes, descent, alliances, &amp;c., to
     which the lower, as well as the higher order of Irish in the
     provincial parts are much addicted.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Prince, too, has thrice honoured me with a visit. Although he
      possesses nothing of the erudition which distinguishes his all-intelligent
      chaplain, yet there is a peculiar charm, a spell in his conversation, that
      is irresistibly fascinating; and chiefly arising, I believe, from the
      curious felicity of his expressions, the originality of the ideas they
      clothe, the strength and energy of his delivery, and the enthusiasm and
      simplicity of his manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seems not so much to speak the English language, as literally to
      translate the Irish; and he borrows so much and so happily from the
      peculiar idiom of his vernacular tongue, that though his conversation was
      deficient in matter, it would still possess a singular interest from its
      manner. But it is far otherwise, there is indeed in the uncultivated mind
      of this man, much of the <i>vivida vis anima</i> of native genius, which
      neither time nor misfortune has wholly damped, and which frequently flings
      the brightest coruscations of thought over the generally pensive tone that
      pervades his conversation. The extent of his knowledge on subjects of
      national interest is indeed wonderful; his memory is rich in oral
      tradition, and most happily faithful to the history and antiquities of his
      country, which notwithstanding peevish complaints of its degeneracy, he
      still loves with idolatrous fondness. On these subjects he is always borne
      away, but upon no subject does he speak with coolness or moderation; he is
      always in extremes, and the vehemence of his gestures and looks ever
      corresponds to the energy of his expressions or sentiments. Yet he
      possesses an infinite deal of that <i>suavito in modo</i>, so prevailing
      and insinuating even among the lower classes of this country; and his
      natural, or I should rather say his national politeness, frequently
      induces him to make the art in which he supposes me to excel, the topic of
      our conversation. While he speaks in rapture of the many fine views this
      country affords to the genius of the painter, he dwells with melancholy
      pleasure on the innumerable ruined palaces and abbeys which lay scattered
      amidst the richest scenes of this romantic province: he generally thus
      concludes with a melancholy apostrophe:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the splendid dwelling of princely grandeur, the awful asylum of
      monastic piety, are just mouldering into oblivion with the memory of those
      they once sheltered. The sons of little men triumph over those whose arm
      was strong in war, and whose voice breathed no impotent command; and the
      descendant of the mighty chieftain has nothing left to distinguish him
      from the son of the peasant, but the decaying ruins of his ancestor&rsquo;s
      castle; while the blasts of a few storms, and the pressure of a few years,
      shall even of them leave scarce a wreck to tell the traveller the mournful
      tale of fallen greatness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I showed him a sketch I had made of the castle of Inismore, on the
      evening I had first seen it from the mountain&rsquo;s summit, he seemed much
      gratified, and warmly commended its fidelity, shaking his head as he
      contemplated it, and impressively exclaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many a morning&rsquo;s sun has seen me climb that mountain in my boyish days,
      to contemplate these ruins, accompanied by an old follower of the family,
      who possessed many strange stories of the feats of my ancestors, with
      which I was then greatly delighted. And then I dreamed of my arm wielding
      the spear in war, and my hall resounding to the song of the bard, and the
      mirth of the feast; but it was only a dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the injury sustained by my left arm (which is in a state of rapid
      convalescence) is no impediment to the exertions of my right, we have
      already talked over the various views I am to take, and he enters into
      every little plan with that enthusiasm, which childhood betrays in the
      pursuit of some novel object, and seems wonderfully gratified in the idea
      of thus perpetuating the fast decaying features of this &ldquo;time honoured&rdquo;
       edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest assures me, I am distinguished in a particular manner by the
      partiality and condescension of the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a man of genius,&rdquo; said he this morning, &ldquo;you have awakened a stronger
      interest in his breast, than if you had presented him with letters patent
      of your nobility, except, indeed, you had derived them from <i>Milesius</i>
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An enthusiastic love of talent is one of the distinguishing features of
      the true ancient Irish character; and independent of your general
      acquirements, your professional abilities, coinciding with his ruling
      passion, secures you a larger portion of his esteem and regard than he
      generally lavishes upon any stranger, and almost incredible, considering
      you are an Englishman. But national prejudice ceases to operate when
      individual worth calls for approbation; and an Irishman seldom asks or
      considers the country of him whose sufferings appeal to his humanity,
      whose genius makes a claim on his applause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, my good friend, while I am thus ingratiating myself with the father,
      the daughter (either self-wrapped in proud reserve, or determined to do
      away that temerity she may have falsely supposed her condescension and
      pity awakened) has not appeared even at the door of my chamber with a
      charitable inquiry for my health, since our last silent, but eloquent
      interview; and I have lived for these three days on the recollection of
      those precious moments which gave her to my view, as I last beheld her,
      like the angel of pity hovering round the pillow of mortal suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! you will say, this is not the language of an apathist, of one &ldquo;whom
      man delighteth not, nor <i>woman</i> either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But let not your vivid imagination thus hurry over at once the scale of my
      feelings from one extreme to the other, forgetting the many intermediate
      degrees that lie between the deadly chill of the coldest, and the burning
      ardour of the most vehement of all human sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am less an apathist, which I am willing to confess, trust me, I am
      not a whit more the lover.&mdash;Lover!&mdash;Preposterous! I am merely
      interested for this girl on a philosophical principle, I long to study the
      purely national, natural character of an Irish woman: In fine, I long to
      behold any woman in such lights and shades of mind, temper, and
      disposition, as nature has originally formed her in. Hitherto I have only
      met servile copies, sketched by the finger of art and finished off by the
      polished touch of fashion I fear, however, that this girl is already
      spoiled by the species of education she has received. The priest has more
      than once spoke of her erudition! <i>Erudition!</i> the pedantry of a
      school-boy of the third class, I suppose. How much must a woman lose, and
      how little can she gain, by that commutation which gives her our
      acquirements for her own graces! For my part, you know, I have always kept
      clear of the <i>basbleus</i>; and would prefer one playful charm of a <i>Ninon</i>
      to all the classic lore of a <i>Dacier</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will say, I could scarcely come off worse with the pedants than I
      did with the dunces; and you will say right. And, to confess the truth, I
      believe I should have been easily led to desert the standard of the pretty
      <i>fools</i>, had female pedantry ever stole on my heart under such a form
      as the little <i>soi-disant</i> Princess of Inis-more. &rsquo;Tis indeed,
      impossible to look <i>less</i> like one who spouts Latin with the priest
      of the parish than this same Glorvina. There is something beautifully wild
      about her air and look, that is indescribable; and, without a very perfect
      regularity of feature, she possesses that effulgency of countenance, that
      bright <i>lumine purpureo</i>, which poetry assigns to the dazzling
      emanations of divine beauty. In short, there are a thousand little
      fugitive graces playing around her, which are not beauty, but the cause of
      it; and were I to personify the word <i>spell</i>, she should sit for the
      picture........ A thousand times she swims before my sight, as I last
      beheld her; her locks of living gold parting on her brow of snow, yet
      seeming to separate with reluctance, as they were lightly shaken off with
      that motion of the head, at once so infantile and graceful; a motion twice
      put into play, as her recumbent attitude poured the luxuriancy of her
      tresses over her face and neck, for she was unveiled, and a small gold
      bodkin was unequal to support the redundancy of that beautiful hair, which
      I more than once apostrophized in the words of Petrarch:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Onde totse amor l&rsquo;oro e di qual vena

      Per far due treccie bionde, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand a servant is dispatched once a week to the next post town,
      with and for letters; and this intelligence absolutely amazed me; for I am
      astonished that these beings, who
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Look not like the inhabitants of the earth,

    <p class="indent15">
      And yet are on it,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      should hold an intercourse with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is post day, and this packet is at last destined to be finished and
      dispatched. On looking it over, the title of princes and princess so often
      occur, that I could almost fancy myself at the court of some foreign
      potentate, basking in the warm sunshine of regal favour, instead of being
      the chance guest of a poor Irish gentleman, who lives on the produce of a
      few rented farms, and, infected with a species of pleasant mania, believes
      himself as much a prince as the heir apparent of boundless empire and
      exhaustless treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu! Direct as usual: for though I certainly mean to accept the
      invitation of a Prince, yet I intend, in a few days, to return home, to
      obviate suspicion, and to have my books and wardrobe removed to the Lodge,
      which now possesses a stronger magnet of attraction than when I first
      fixed on it as my headquarters.

    <h3>
      LETTER VII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his is the sixth
      day of my convalescence, and the first of my descent from my western
      tower; for I find it is literally in a tower, or turret, which terminates
      a wing of these ruins, I have been lodged. These good people, however,
      would have persuaded me into the possession of a slow fever, and confined
      me to my room another day, had not the harp of Glorvina, with
      &ldquo;supernatural solicitings,&rdquo; spoken more irresistibly to my heart than all
      their eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just made my <i>toilette</i>, for the first time since my arrival
      at the castle; and with a black ribbon of the nurse&rsquo;s across my forehead,
      and a silk handkerchief of the priest&rsquo;s supporting my arm, with my own
      &ldquo;customary suit of solemn black,&rdquo; tintless cheek, languid eye, and pensive
      air, I looked indeed as though &ldquo;melancholy had marked me for her own or an
      excellent personification of pining atrophy&rdquo; in its last stage of decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I contemplated my <i>memento mori</i> of a figure in the glass, I
      heard a harp tuning in an underneath apartment. The Prince I knew had not
      yet left his bed, for his infirmities seldom permit him to rise early; the
      priest had rode out; and the venerable figure of the old harper at that
      moment gave a fine effect to a ruined arch under which he was passing, led
      by a boy, just opposite my window. &ldquo;It is Glorwna then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
      alone!&rdquo; and down I sallied; but not with half the intrepidity that Sir
      Bertram followed the mysterious blue flame along the corridors of the
      enchanted castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand times since my arrival in this transmundane region, I have had
      reason to feel how much we are the creatures of situation; how insensibly
      our minds and our feelings take their tone from the influence of existing
      circumstances. You have seen me frequently the very prototype of <i>nonchalence</i>,
      in the midst of a circle of birthday beauties, that might have put the
      fabled charms of the <i>Mount Ida triumviri</i> to the blush of
      inferiority. Yet here I am, groping my way down the dismantled stone
      stairs of a ruined castle in the wilds of Connaught, with my heart
      fluttering like the pulse of green eighteen, in the presence of its first
      love, merely because on the point of appearing before a simple rusticated
      girl, whose father calls himself <i>a prince</i>, with a <i>potatoe ridge
      for his dominions!</i> O! with what indifference I should have met her in
      the drawingroom, or at the opera!&mdash;there she would have been merely a
      woman!&mdash;here she is the fairy vision of my heated fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, having finished the same circuitous journey that a squirrel
      diurnally performs in his cage, I found myself landed in a stone passage,
      which was terminated by the identical chamber of fatal memory already
      mentioned, and through the vista of a huge folding door, partly thrown
      back, beheld the form of Glorvina! She was alone, and bending over her
      harp; one arm was gracefully thrown over the instrument, which she was
      tuning; with the other she was lightly modulating on its chords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too timid to proceed, yet unwilling to retreat, I was still hovering near
      the door, when turning round, she observed me, and I advanced. She blushed
      to the eyes, and returned my profound bow with a slight inclination of the
      head, as if I were unworthy a more marked obeisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in the theory of sentiment could be more diametrically opposite,
      than the bashful indication of that crimson blush, and the haughty spirit
      of that graceful bow. What a logical analysis would it have afforded to
      Father John on innate and acquired ideas! Her blush was the effusion of
      nature; her bow the result of inculcation&mdash;the one spoke the native
      woman; the other the <i>ideal</i> princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      I endeavoured to apologize for my intrusion; and she, in a manner that
      amazed me, congratulated me on my recovery; then drawing her harp towards
      her, she seated herself on the great Gothic couch, with a motion of the
      hand, and a look, that seemed to say, &ldquo;there is room for you too.&rdquo; I bowed
      my acceptance of the silent welcome invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold me then seated <i>tete-a-tete</i> with this Irish Princess!&mdash;my
      right arm thrown over her harp, and her eyes riveted on my left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still feel any pain from it?&rdquo; said she, so naturally, as though we
      had actually been discussing the accident it had sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you believe it! I never thought of making her an answer; but
      fastened my eyes on her face. For a moment she raised her glance to mine,
      and we both coloured, as if she read there&mdash;I know not what!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I, recovering from the spell of this magic
      glance&mdash;&ldquo;you made some observation, Madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I recollect,&rdquo; she replied, with a slight confusion of manner,
      and running her finger carelessly over the chords of the harp, till it
      came in contact with my own, which hung over it. The touch circulated like
      electricity through every vein. I impulsively arose, and walked to the
      window from whence I had first heard the tones of that instrument which
      had been the innocent accessory to my present unaccountable emotion. As if
      I were measuring the altitude of my fall, I hung half my body out of the
      window, thinking, Heaven knows, of nothing less than <i>that</i> fall, of
      nothing more than its fair cause, until abruptly drawing in my dizzy head,
      I perceived her&rsquo;s (such a cherub head you never beheld!) leaning against
      her harp, and her eye directed towards me. I know not why, yet I felt at
      once confused and gratified by this observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fall,&rdquo; said I, glad of something to say, to relieve my school-boy
      bashfulness, &ldquo;was greater than I suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was dreadful!&rdquo; she replied shuddering &ldquo;What could have led you to so
      perilous a situation?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;which has led to more certain destruction, senses
      more strongly fortified than mine&mdash;the voice of a syren!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then briefly related to her the rise, decline, and fall of my physical
      empire; obliged, however, to qualify the gallantry of my <i>debut</i> by
      the subsequent plainness of my narration, for the delicate reserve of her
      air made me tremble, lest I had gone too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      By heavens I cannot divest myself of a feeling of inferiority in her
      presence, as though I were actually that poor, wandering, unconnected
      being I have feigned myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My compliment was received with a smile and a blush; and to the eulogium
      which rounded my detail on the benevolence and hospitality of the family
      of Inismore, she replied, that &ldquo;had the accident been of less material
      consequence to myself, the family of Inismore must have rejoiced at the
      event which enriched its social circle with so desirable an acquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>matter</i> of this little <i>politesse</i> was nothing; but the <i>manner</i>,
      the air, with which it was delivered! Where can she have acquired this
      elegance of manner?&mdash;reared amidst rocks, and woods, and mountains!
      deprived of all those graceful advantages which society confers&mdash;a
      manner too that is at perpetual variance with her looks, which are so <i>naif</i>&mdash;-I
      had almost said so wildly simple&mdash;that while she speaks in the
      language of a court, she looks like the artless inhabitant of a cottage:&mdash;a
      smile, and a blush, rushing to her cheek, and her lip, as the impulse of
      fancy or feeling directs, even when smiles and blushes are irrevalent to
      the etiquette of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This elegance of manner, then, must be the pure result of elegance of
      soul; and if there is a charm in woman, I have hitherto vainly sought, and
      prized beyond all I have discovered, it is this refined, celestial, native
      elegance of soul, which effusing its spell through every thought, word,
      and motion, of its enviable possessor, resembles the peculiar property of
      gold, which subtilely insinuates itself through the most minute and
      various particles, without losing any thing of its own intrinsic nature by
      the amalgamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the flattering observation which had elicited this digression
      I replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      That far from regretting the consequences, I was emamoured of an accident
      that had procured me such happiness as I now enjoyed (even with the risk
      of life itself;) and that I believed there were few who, like me, would
      not prefer peril to security, were the former always the purchase of such
      felicity as the latter, at least on me, had never bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this reply savoured too much of the world&rsquo;s commonplace gallantry,
      or that she thought there was more of the head than the heart in it, I
      know not; but, by my soul, in spite of a certain haughty motion of the
      head not unfrequent with her, I thought she looked wonderfully inclined to
      laugh in my face, though she primed up her mouth, and fancied she looked
      like a nun, when her lip pouted with the smiling archness of a Hebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, I never felt more in all its luxury the comfort of looking like
      a fool; and to do away the no very agreeable sensation which the
      conviction of being laughed at awakens, as a <i>pis-aller</i>, I began to
      examine the harp, and expressed the surprise I felt at its singular
      construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of music?&rdquo; she asked with <i>naivette</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufficiently so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to risk my life for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and cast a look at the window, as much as to say, &ldquo;I
      understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I now was engaged in examining her harp, I observed that it resembled
      less any instrument of that kind I had seen, than the drawing of the
      Davidic lyre in Montfaucon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said she, with animation, &ldquo;this is another collateral proof of the
      antiquity of its origin, which I never before heard adduced, and which
      sanctions that universally received tradition among us, by which we learn,
      that we are indebted to the first Milesian colony that settled here for
      this charming instrument, although some modern historians suppose that we
      obtained it from Scandinavia.&rdquo; *

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is reserved for the national Lyre of Erin only, to
     claim a title independent of a Gothic origin. For &ldquo;Clar-
     seach,&rdquo; is the only Irish epithet for the harp, a name more
     in unison with the cithera of the Greeks, and even the
     chinor of the Hebrew, than the Anglo-Saxon harp. &ldquo;I cannot
     but think the clarseach, or Irish harp, one of the most
     ancient instruments we have among us, and had perhaps its
     origin in remote periods of antiquity.&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Bedford&rsquo;s Essay
     on the construction, &amp;c. of the Irish Harp.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this, Madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the original ancient Irish harp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, for I have strung it with gut instead of wire, merely for
      the gratification of my own ear; but it is, however, precisely the same
      form as that preserved in the Irish university, which belonged to one of
      the most celebrated of our heroes, Brian Boni; for the warrior and the
      bard often united in the character of our kings, and they sung the
      triumphs of those departed chiefs whose feats they emulated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she added with a smile, while my eager glance pursued the
      kindling animation of her countenance as she spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;you see, that
      in all which concerns my national music, I speak with national enthusiasm;
      and much indeed do we stand indebted to the most charming of all the
      sciences for the eminence it has obtained us; for in <i>music only</i>, do
      <i>you</i> English allow us poor Irish any superiority; and therefore your
      King, who made the <i>harp</i> the armorial bearing of Ireland,
      perpetuated our former musical celebrity beyond the power of time or
      prejudice to destroy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not for the world would I have annihilated the triumph which this fancied
      superiority seemed to give to this patriotic little being, by telling her,
      that we thought as little of the music of her country, as of every thing
      else that related to it; and that all we knew of the style of its
      melodies, reached us through the false medium of comic airs, sung by some
      popular actor, who in coincidence with his author, caricatures those
      national traits he attempts to delineate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore simply told her, that though I doubted not the former musical
      celebrity of her country, yet that I perceived the <i>Bardic</i> order in
      Wales seemed to have survived the tuneful race of <i>Erin</i>; for that
      though every little Cambrian village had its harper, I had not yet met
      with one of the profession in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved her head with a melancholy air, and replied&mdash;&ldquo;the rapid
      decline of the Sons of Song, once the pride of our country, is indeed very
      evident; and the tones of that tender and expressive instrument which gave
      birth to those which now survive them in happier countries, no longer
      vibrates in our own; for of course you are not ignorant that the
      importation of Irish bards and Irish instruments into Wales, * by <i>Griffith
      ap Conan</i>, formed an epocha in Welch music, and awakened there a genius
      of style in composition, which still breathes a kindred spirit to that
      from whence it derived its being, and that even the invention of Scottish
      music is given to Ireland.&rdquo;! **
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I must plead ignorance to this singular fact, and
      almost to every other connected with this <i>now</i> to me most
      interesting country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then suffer me,&rdquo; said she, with a most insinuating smile, &ldquo;to indulge
      another little national triumph over you, by informing you, that we learn
      from musical record, that the first piece of music ever seen in <i>score</i>,
      in Great Britain, is an air sung time immemmorial in this country on the
      opening of summer&mdash;an air, which though animated in its measure, yet
      still, like all the Irish melodies, breathes the very soul of melancholy.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Cardoc (of Lhancarvan) without any of that illiberal
     partiality so common with national writers, assures us that
     the Irish devised all the instruments, tunes, and measures,
     in use among the Welsh. Cambrensis is even more copious in
     its praise, when he peremptorily declares that the Irish,
     above any other nation, is incomparably skilled in symphonal
     music.&mdash;Walker&rsquo;s Hist. Mem. of the Irish Bards

     Hist. Irish Bards, p. 131,32.

     brought Summer along with us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do your melodies then, Madam, breathe the soul of melancholy?&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our national music,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;like our national character, admits
      of no medium in sentiment: it either sinks our spirit to despondency, by
      its heartbreaking pathos, or elevates it to wildness by its exhilarating
      animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part, I confess myself the victim of its magic&mdash;an Irish
      planxty cheers me into maddening vivacity; an Irish lamentation depresses
      me into a sadness of melancholy emotion, to which the energy of despair
      might be deemed comparative felicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Imagine how I felt while she spoke&mdash;but you cannot conceive the
      feelings unless you beheld and heard the object who inspired them&mdash;unless
      you watched the kindling lumination of her countenance, and the varying
      hue of that mutable complexion, which seemed to ebb and flow to the
      impulse of every sentiment she expressed; while her round and sighing
      voice modulated in unison with each expression it harmonized.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s pause she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This susceptibility to the influence of my country&rsquo;s music, discovered
      itself in a period of existence when no associating sentiment of the heart
      could have called it into being; for I have often wept in convulsive
      emotion at an air, before the sad story it accompanied was understood: but
      now&mdash;now&mdash;that feeling is matured, and understanding awakened.
      Oh! you cannot judge&mdash;cannot feel&mdash;for you have no national
      music; and your country is the happiest under heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice faltered as she spoke&mdash;her fingers seemed impulsively to
      thrill on the chords of the harp&mdash;her eyes, her tear swollen,
      beautiful eyes, were thrown up to heaven, and her voice, &ldquo;low and mournful
      as the song of the tomb,&rdquo; sighed over the chords of her national lyre, as
      she faintly murmured Campbell&rsquo;s beautiful poem to the ancient Irish air of
      <i>Erin go brack!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! is there on earth a being so cold, so icy, so insensible, as to have
      made a comment, even an <i>encomiastic</i> one, when this song of the soul
      ceased to breathe! God knows how little I was inclined or empowered to
      make the faintest eulogium, or disturb the sacred silence which succeeded
      to her music&rsquo;s dying murmur. On the contrary, I sat silent and motionless,
      with my head unconsciously leaning on my broken arm, and my handkerchief
      to my eyes: when at last I withdrew it, I found her hurried glance fixed
      on me with a smile of such expression! Oh! I could weep my heart&rsquo;s most
      vital drop for such another glance&mdash;such another smile!&mdash;they
      seemed to say, but who dares to translate the language of the soul, which
      the eye only can express?
    </p>
    <p>
      In (I believe) equal emotion, we both arose at the same moment and walked
      to the window. Beyond the mass of ruins which spread in desolate confusion
      below, the ocean, calm and unruffled, expanded its awful bosom almost to
      infinitude; while a body of dark, sullen clouds, tinged with the partial
      beam of a meridian sun, floated above the summits of those savage cliffs
      which skirt this bold and rocky coast; and the tall spectral figure of
      Father John, leaning on a broken pediment, appeared like the embodied
      spirit of philosophy moralizing amidst the ruins of empires, on the
      instability of all human greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sublime assemblage of images.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How consonant,&rdquo; thought I, gazing at Glorvina, &ldquo;to the sublimated tone of
      our present feelings.&rdquo; Glorvina waved her head in accidence to the idea,
      as though my lips had given it birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      How think you I felt, on this sweet involuntary acknowledgment of a mutual
      intelligence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, my eyes, too faithful I fear to my feelings, covered
      the face on which they were passionately riveted with blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Glorvina was summoned to dinner by a servant, for she only
      is permitted to dine with the Prince, as being of royal descent. The
      vision dissolved&mdash;she was again the proud Milesian Princess, and I
      the poor wandering <i>artist</i>&mdash;the eleemosynary guest of her
      hospitable mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest and I dined <i>tete-a-tete</i>; and, for the first time, he had
      all the conversation to himself; and got deep in Locke and Malbranche, in
      solving quidities, and starting hypothesis, to which I assented with great
      gravity, and thought only of Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      I again beheld her gracefully drooping over her harp&mdash;I again caught
      the melody of her song, and the sentiment it conveyed to the soul; and I
      entered fully into the idea of the Greek painter, who drew <i>Love</i>,
      not with a bow and arrow, but a lyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not avoid mentioning with admiration her great musical powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she inherits them from her mother, who obtained the
      appellation of <i>Glorvina</i>, from the sweetness of her voice, by which
      name our little friend was baptized at her mother&rsquo;s request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adieu! Glorvina has been confined in her father&rsquo;s room during the whole of
      the evening&mdash;to this circumstance you are indebted for this long
      letter.

      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he invitation I
      received from the hospitable Lord of these ruins, was so unequivocal, so
      cordial, that it would have been folly, not delicacy to think of turning
      out of his house the moment my health was re-established. But then, I
      scarcely felt it warranted that length of residence here, which, for a
      thousand reasons, I am now anxious to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prolong my visit till the arrival of my father in this country was my
      object; and how to effect the desired purpose, was the theme of my
      cogitation during the whole of the restless night which succeeded my
      interview with Glorvina; and to confess the truth, I believe this
      interview was not the least potent spell which fascinated me to Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied by my restlessness, rather than refreshed by my transient
      slumbers, I arose with the dawn, and carrying my <i>port-feuille</i> and
      pencils with me, descended from my tower, and continued to wander for some
      time among the wild and romantic scenes which surround these interesting
      ruins, while

    <p class="indent15">

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      until almost wearied in the contemplation of the varying sublimities which
      the changes of the morning&rsquo;s seasons shed over the ocean&rsquo;s boundless
      expanse, from the first gray vapour that arose from its swelling wave, to
      that splendid refulgence with which the risen sun crimsoned its bosom, I
      turned away my dazzled eye, and fixed it on the ruins of Inismore. Never
      did it appear in an aspect so picturesquely felicitous: it was a golden
      period for the poet&rsquo;s fancy or the painter&rsquo;s art; and in a moment of
      propitious genius, I made one of the most interesting sketches my pencil
      ever produced. I had just finished my successful <i>ebauche</i>, when
      Father John, returning from matins, observed, and instantly joined me.
      When he had looked over and commended the result of my morning&rsquo;s
      avocation, he gave my port-folio to a servant who passed us, and taking my
      arm, we walked down together to the seashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This happy specimen of your talent,&rdquo; said he, as we proceeded, &ldquo;will be
      very grateful to the Prince. In him, who has no others left, it is a very
      innocent pride, to wish to perpetuate the fading honours of his family&mdash;for
      as such the good Prince considers these <i>ruins</i>. But, my young
      friend, there is another and a surer path to the Prince&rsquo;s heart, to which
      I should be most happy to lead you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment, and then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, I hope, pardon the liberty I am going to take; but as I boast
      the merit of having first made your merit known to your worthy host, I
      hold myself in some degree (smiling and pressing my hand) accountable for
      your confirming the partiality I have awakened in your favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter of the Prince, and my pupil, of whom you can have yet formed
      no opinion, is a creature of such rare endowments, that it should seem
      Nature, as if foreseeing her isolated destiny, had opposed her own
      liberality to the chariness of fortune; and lavished on her such intuitive
      talents, that she almost sets the necessity of education at defiance. To
      all that is most excellent in the circle of human intellect, or human
      science, her versatile genius is constantly directed; and it is my real
      opinion, that nothing more is requisite to perfect her in any liberal or
      elegant pursuit, but that method or system which even the strangest native
      talent, unassisted, can seldom attain (without a long series of practical
      experience) and which is unhappily denied her; while her doating father
      incessantly mourns that poverty, which withholds from him the power of
      cultivating those shining abilities that would equally enrich the solitude
      of their possessor, or render her an ornament to that society she may yet
      be destined to grace. Yet the occasional visits of a strolling
      dancing-master, and a few musical lessons received in her early childhood
      from the family bard, are all the advantages these native talents have
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who that ever beheld her motions in the dance, or listened to the
      exquisite sensibility of her song, but would exclaim&mdash;&lsquo;here is a
      creature for whom Art can do nothing&mdash;Nature has done all!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To these elegant acquirements, she unites a decided talent for drawing,
      arising from powers naturally imitative, and a taste early imbibed (from
      the contemplation of her native scenes) for all that is most sublime and
      beautiful in nature. But this, of all her talents, has been the least
      assisted, and yet is the most prized by her father, who, I believe,
      laments his inability to detain you here as her preceptor; or rather, to
      make it worth your while to forego your professional pursuits, for such a
      period as would be necessary to invest her with such rudiments in the art,
      as would form a basis for her future improvement. In a word, can you,
      consistently with your present plans, make the castle of Inismore your
      headquarters for two or three months, from whence you can take frequent
      excursions amidst the neighbouring scenery, which will afford to your
      pencil subjects rich and various as almost any other part of the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the course of my life, I have had more than one occasion to remark
      certain desirable events brought about by means diametrically opposite to
      the supposition of all human probability;&mdash;but that this worthy man
      should (as if infected with the intriguing spirit of a French Abbe reared
      in the purlieus of the <i>Louvre</i>) thus forward my views, and effect
      the realization of my wishes, excited so strong an emotion of pleasurable
      surprise, that I with difficulty repressed my smiles, or concealed my
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      After, however, a short pause, I replied with great gravity, that I always
      conceived with Pliny, that the dignity we possess by the good offices of a
      friend, is a kind of sacred trust, wherein we have his judgment as well as
      our own character to maintain, and therefore to be guarded with peculiar
      attention; that consequently, on his account, I was as anxious as on my
      own, to confirm the good opinion conceived in my favour through the medium
      of his partiality; and with very great sincerity I assured him, that I
      knew of no one event so coincident to my present views of happiness, as
      the power of making the Prince some return for his benevolent attentions,
      and of becoming his (the priest&rsquo;s) coadjutor in the tuition of his highly
      gifted pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Add then, my dear Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to all the obligations you have forced
      on me, by presenting my respectful compliments to the Prince, with the
      offer of my little services, and an earnest request that he will
      condescend to accept of them; and if you think it will add to the delicacy
      of the offer, let him suppose that it voluntarily comes from the heart
      deeply impressed with a sense of his kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what I was going to propose,&rdquo; returned this excellent
      and unsuspecting being. &ldquo;I would even wish him to think you conceive the
      obligation all on your own side; for the pride of fallen greatness is of
      all others the most sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And God knows so I do,&rdquo; said I, fervently,&mdash;then carelessly added,
      &ldquo;do you think your pupil has a decided talent for the art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be partiality,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but I think she has a decided talent
      for every elegant acquirement. If I recollect right, somebody has defined
      <i>genius</i> to be &lsquo;the various powers of a strong mind directed to one
      point:&rsquo; making it the <i>result</i> of combined force, not the vital
      source, whence all intellectual powers flow; in which light, the genius of
      Glorvina has ever appeared to me as a beam from heaven, an emanation of
      divine intelligence, whose nutritive warmth cherishes into existence that
      richness and variety of talent which wants only a little care to rear it
      to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I first offered to become the preceptor to this charming child, her
      father, I believe, never formed an idea that my tuition would have
      extended beyond a little reading and writing; but I soon found that my
      interesting pupil possessed a genius that bore all before it&mdash;that
      almost anticipated instruction by force of its tuitive powers, and prized
      each task assigned it, only in proportion to the difficulty by which it
      was to be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her young ambitious mind even emulated rivalry with mine, and that study
      in which she beheld me engaged seldom failed to become the object of her
      desires and her assiduity. Availing myself, therefore, of this innate
      spirit of emulation&mdash;this boundless thirst of knowledge, I left her
      mind free in the election of its studies, while I only threw within its
      power of acquisition, that which could tend to render her a rational, and
      consequently a benevolent being; for I have always conceived an informed,
      intelligent, and enlightened mind, to be the best security for a good
      heart; although the many who mistake talent for intellect, and
      unfortunately too often find the former united to vice, and led to suppose
      that the heart loses in goodness what the mind acquires in strength, as if
      (as a certain paradoxical writer has asserted) there was something in the
      natural mechanism of the human frame necessary to constitute a fine genius
      that is not altogether favourable to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here comes the unconscious theme of our conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at that moment Glorvina appeared, springing lightly forward, like
      Gresset&rsquo;s beautiful personification of health:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;As Hebe swift, as Venus fair,

    <p class="indent20">
      Youthful, lovely, light as air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she perceived me she stopt abruptly, blushed, and returning my
      salutation, advanced to the priest, and twining her arm familiarly in his,
      said, with an air of playful tenderness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! I have brought you something you will be glad to see&mdash;here is the
      spring&rsquo;s first violet, which the unusual chilliness of the season has
      suffered to steal into existence: this morning as I gathered herbs at the
      foot of the mountain, I inhaled its odour ere I discovered its purple
      head, as solitary and unassociated it was drooping beneath the heavy
      foliage of a neighbouring plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but just you should have the first violet as my father has already
      had the first snowdrop. Receive, then, my offering,&rdquo; she added with a
      smile; and while she fondly placed it in his breast with an air of
      exquisite <i>naivette</i>, to my astonishment she repeated from B. Tasso,
      those lines so consonant to the tender simplicity of the act in which she
      was engaged:

    <p>
      The priest gazed at her with looks of parental affection, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your offering, my dear, is indeed the
    </p>

    <p>
      and more precious to the receiver, than the richest donation that ever
      decked the shrine of Loretto. How fragrant it is!&rdquo; he added, presenting it
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took it in silence, but raised it no higher than my lip&mdash;the eye of
      Glorvina met mine, as my kiss breathed upon her flower: Good God! what an
      undefinable, what a delicious emotion thrilled through my heart at that
      moment! and the next&mdash;yet I know not how it was, or whether the
      motion was made by her, or by me, or by the priest&mdash;but somehow,
      Glorvina had got between us, and while I gazed at her beautiful flower, I
      personified the blossom, and addressed to her the happiest lines that form
      &ldquo;<i>La Guirlande de Julie</i>&rdquo; while, as I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Mais si sur votre front je peux briller un jour,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I reposed it for a moment on her brow in passing it over to the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, with an arch smile, &ldquo;I perceive you too will expect a
      tributary flower for these charming lines; and the summer&rsquo;s first rose&rdquo;&mdash;she
      paused abruptly; but her eloquent eye continued, &ldquo;should be thine, but
      that thou mayst be far from hence when the summer&rsquo;s first rose appears.&rdquo; I
      thought too&mdash;but it might be only the fancy of my wishes, that a sigh
      floated on the lip, when recollection checked the effusion of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>rose</i>,&rdquo; (said the priest, with simplicity, and more engaged
      with the classicality of the idea, than the inference to be drawn from
      it,) &ldquo;the rose is the flower of Love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stole a look at Glorvina, whose cheek now emulated the tint of the theme
      of our conversation; and plucking a thistle that sprung from a broken
      pediment, she blew away its down with her balmy breath, merely to hide her
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely she is the most sentient of all created beings!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; continued the priest, &ldquo;being severely censured by a rigid
      old priest, at my college in St. Omer&rsquo;s, who found me reading the Idylium
      of Ausonius, in which he so beautifully celebrates the rose, when the good
      father believed me deep in St. Augustin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has always been the poet&rsquo;s darling theme. The
      impassioned lyre of Sappho has breathed upon its leaves. Anacreon has
      wooed it in the happiest effusions of his genius; and poesy seems to have
      exhausted her powers in celebrating the charms of the most beautiful and
      transient of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among its modern panegyrists, few have been more happily successful than
      Monsieur de Barnard, in that charming little ode beginning:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Tendre fruits des pleurs d&rsquo;aurore,

    <p class="indent15">
      Reine de l&rsquo;empire de Flore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Hate toi d&rsquo;epanoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! I beseech you go on,&rdquo; exclaimed Glor-vina; and at her request, I
      finished the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful!&rdquo; said she, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;O! there is a certain
      delicacy of genius in elegant trifles of this description, which I think
      the French possess almost exclusively: it is a language formed almost by
      its very construction <i>a&rsquo;eterniser la bagatelle</i>, and to clothe the
      fairy effusions of fancy in the most appropriate drapery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for this beautiful ode; the rose was always my idol flower;
      in all its different stages of existence, it speaks a language my heart
      understands; from its young bud&rsquo;s first crimson glow, to the last sickly
      blush of its faded blossom. It is the flower of sentiment in all its sweet
      transitions; it breathes a moral, and seems to preserve an undecaying soul
      in that fragrant essence which still survives the bloom and symmetry of
      the fragile form which every beam too ardent, every gale too chill,
      injures and destroys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no parallel in the moral world for this lovely
      offspring of the natural?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina raised her humid eyes to mine, and I read the parallel there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I vow,&rdquo; said the priest, with affected pettishness, &ldquo;I am half tempted to
      fling away my violet, since this <i>idol</i> flower has been decreed to
      Mr. Mortimer; and to revenge myself, I will show him your ode on the
      rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, he took out his pocket-book, laughing at his gratified
      vengeance, while Glorvina coaxed, blushed, and threatened; until snatching
      the book out of his hand, as he was endeavouring to put it into mine, away
      she flew like lightning, laughing heartily at her triumph, in all the
      exility and playfulness of a youthful spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a <i>Hebe!</i>&rdquo; said I, as she kissed her hand to us in her airy
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she at least illustrates the possibility of a woman
      uniting in her character the extremes of intelligence and simplicity: you
      see, with all her information and talent, she is a mere child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the castle, we found her waiting for us at the breakfast
      table, flushed with her race&mdash;all animation, all spirits! her reserve
      seemed gradually to vanish, and nothing could be more interesting, yet
      more <i>enjouee</i>, than her manner and conversation. While the fertility
      of her imagination supplied incessant topic of conversation, always new,
      always original, I could not help reverting in idea to those languid <i>tete-a-tetes</i>,
      even in the hey-dey of our intercourse, when Lady C.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      and I have sat yawning at each other, or biting our fingers, merely for
      want of something to say, in those intervals of passion, which every
      connexion even of the tenderest nature, must sustain&mdash;she in the
      native dearth of her mind, and I in the habitual apathy of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here is a creature who talks of a violet or a rose with the artless
      air of infancy, and yet fascinates you in the simple discussion, as though
      the whole force of intellect was roused to support it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Heaven! if I know my own heart, I would not love this being for a
      thousand worlds; at least as I have hitherto loved. As it is, I feel a
      certain commerce of the soul&mdash;a mutual intelligence of mind and
      feeling with her, which a look, a sigh, a word is sufficient to betray&mdash;a
      sacred communion of spirit, which raises me in the scale of existence
      almost above mortality; and though we had been known to each other by
      looks only, still would this amalgamation of soul (if I may use the
      expression) have existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a nausea of every sense does the turbulent agitation of gross
      commonplace passion bring with it. But the sentiment which this seraph
      awakens, &ldquo;brings with it no satiety.&rdquo; There is something so pure, so
      refreshing about her, that in the present state of my heart, feelings, and
      constitution, she produces the same effect on me as does the health-giving
      breeze of returning spring to the drooping spirit of slow convalescence!
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast she left us, and I was permitted to kiss his Highness&rsquo;s
      hand, on my instalment in my new and enviable office. He did not speak
      much on the subject, but with his usual energy. However, I understood I
      was not to waste my time, as he termed it, for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I endeavoured to argue the point (as if the whole business was not a
      <i>farce,</i>) the Prince would not hear me; so behold to all intents and
      purposes a hireling tutor. Faith, to confess the truth, I know not whether
      to be pleased or angry with this wild romance: this too, in a man whose
      whole life has been a laugh at romancers of every description.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if my father learns the extent of my folly, in the first era too of
      my probation! Oh! what a spirit of <i>bizarte</i> ever drives me from the
      central point of common sense, and common prudence! With what tyranny does
      impulse rule my wayward fate! and how imperiously my heart still takes the
      lead of my head! yet if I could ever consider the &ldquo;meteor ray&rdquo; that has
      hitherto mis led my wanderings, as a &ldquo;light from heaven,&rdquo; it is now, when
      virtue leads me to the shrine of innocent pleasure; and the mind becomes
      the better for the wanderings of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; you will say, with your usual foreseeing prudence&mdash;&ldquo;what
      is the aim, the object of your present romantic pursuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faith, none; save the simple enjoyment of present felicity, after an age
      of cold, morbid apathy; and a self resignation to an agreeable illusion,
      after having sustained the actual burthen of real sufferings (sufferings
      the more acute as they were self created,) succeeded by that dearth of
      feeling and sensation which in permitting my heart to lie <i>fallow</i>
      for an interval, only rendered it the more genial to those exotic seeds of
      happiness which the vagrant gale of chance has flung on its surface. But
      whether they will take deep root, or only wear &ldquo;the perfume and suppliance
      of a moment,&rdquo; is an unthought of &ldquo;circumstance still hanging in the
      stars,&rdquo; to whose decision I commit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you know my plans of meditated operation, they run thus:&mdash;In a
      few days I shall avail myself of my professional vocation, and fly home,
      merely to obviate suspicion in Mr. Clendinning, receive and answer
      letters, and get my books and wardrobe sent to the Lodge, previous to my
      own removal there, which I shall effect under the plausible plea of the
      dissipated neighbourhood of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house being
      equally inimical to the present state of my constitution and my studious
      pursuits; and, in fact, I must either associate with, or offend these
      hospitable Milesians&mdash;an alternative by no means consonant to my
      inclinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Inismore to the Lodge, I can make constant sallies, and be in the way
      to receive my father, whose arrival I think I may still date at some
      weeks&rsquo; distance; besides, should it be necessary, I think I should find no
      difficulty in bribing the old steward of the Lodge to my interest. His
      evident aversion to Clendinning, and attachment to the Prince, renders him
      ripe for any scheme by which the latter could be served, or the former
      outwitted: and I hope in the end to effect both: for, to unite this old
      chieftain in bonds of amity with my father, and to punish the rascality of
      the worthy Mr. Clendinning, is a double &ldquo;consummation devoutly to be
      wished.&rdquo; In short, when the heart is interested in a project, the
      stratagems of the imagination to forward it are inexhaustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should seem that the name of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is
      interdicted at Inismore: I have more than once endeavoured (though
      remotely) to make the residence of our family in this country a topic of
      conversation; but every one seemed to shrink from the subject, as though
      some fatality was connected with its discussion. To avoid speaking ill of
      those of whom we have but little reason, speak well, is the temperance of
      aversion, and seldom found but in great minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must mention to you another instance of liberality in the sentiments of
      these isolated beings:&mdash;I have only once attended the celebration of
      divine service here since my arrival; but my absence seemed not to be
      observed, or my attendance noticed; and though, as an Englishman, I may be
      naturally supposed to be of the most popular faith, yet, for all they know
      to the contrary, I may be Jew, Mussulman, or Infidel; for, before me at
      least, religion is a topic never discussed.

    <h3>
      LETTER IX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> have already
      given two lessons to my pupil, in an art in which, with all due deference
      to the judgment of her quondam tutor, she was never destined to excel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not, however, that she is deficient in talent&mdash;very far from it; but
      it is too progressive, too tame a pursuit for the vivacity of her genius.
      It is not sufficiently connected with those lively and vehement emotions
      of the soul she is so calculated to feel and to awaken. She was created
      for a musician&mdash;there she is borne away by the magic of the art in
      which she excels, and the natural enthusiasm of her impassioned character:
      she can sigh, she can weep, she can smile over her harp. The sensibility
      of her soul trembles in her song, and the expression of her rapt
      countenance harmonizes with her voice. But at her drawing-desk, her
      features lose their animated character&mdash;the smile of rapture ceases
      to play, and the glance of inspiration to beam. And with the transient
      extinction of those feelings from which each touching charm is derived,
      fades that all pervading interest, that energy of admiration which she
      usually excites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding, however, the pencil is never out of her hand; her harp
      lies silent, and her drawing-book is scarcely ever closed. Yet she limits
      my attendance to the first hour after breakfast, and then I generally lose
      sight of her the whole day, until we all meet <i>en-famille</i> in the
      evening. Her improvement is rapid&mdash;her father delighted, and she
      quite fascinated by the novelty of her avocation; the priest congratulates
      me, and I alone am dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from the natural impatience and volatility of her character, (both
      very obvious,) this, thank Heaven! will soon be over. Besides, even in the
      hour of tuition, from which I promised myself so much, I do not enjoy her
      society&mdash;the priest always devotes that time to reading out to her;
      and this too at her own request:&mdash;not that I think her innocent and
      unsuspicious nature cherishes the least reserve at her being left <i>tete-a-tete</i>
      with her less venerable preceptor; but that her ever active mind requires
      incessant exercise; and in fact, while I am hanging over her in
      uncontrolled emotion, she is drawing, as if her livelihood depended on the
      exertions of her pencil, or commenting on the subjects of the priest&rsquo;s
      perusal, with as much ease as judgment; while she minds me no more than if
      I were a well organized piece of mechanism, by whose motions her pencil
      was to be guided.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if, with all her mind, all her genius, this creature had no heart!&mdash;And
      what were it to me, though she had?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince fancies his domestic government to be purely patriarchal, and
      that he is at once the &ldquo;Law and the Prophet&rdquo; to his family; never
      suspecting that he is all the time governed by a girl of nineteen, whose
      soul, notwithstanding the playful softness of her manner, contains a
      latent ambition, which sometimes breathing in the grandeur of her
      sentiment, and sometimes sparkling in the haughtiness of her eye, seems to
      say, &ldquo;I was born for empire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that the tone of her mind is naturally stronger than her
      father&rsquo;s, though to a common observe, <i>he</i> would appeal a man of
      nervous and masculine understanding; but the difference between them is
      this&mdash;his energies are the energies of the passions&mdash;hers of the
      mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most other Princes, <i>mine</i> is governed much by <i>favoritism</i>;
      and it is evident I already rank high on the list of partiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceive, however, that much of his predilection in my favour, arises
      from the coincidence of my present curiosity and taste with his favourite
      pursuits and national prejudices. Newly awakened, (perhaps by mere force
      of novelty,) to a lively interest for every thing that concerns a country
      I once thought so little worthy of consideration; in short, convinced by
      the analogy of existing habits, with recorded customs, of the truth of
      those circumstances so generally ranked in the apocryphal tales of the
      history of this vilified country; I have determined to resort to the
      witness of time, the light of truth, and the corroboration of living
      testimony, in the study of a country which I am beginning to think would
      afford to the mind of philosophy a rich subject of analysis, and to the
      powers of poetic fancy a splendid series of romantic detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir William Temple,&rdquo; says Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;complains that Ireland is less
      known than any other country, as to its ancient state, because the natives
      have little leisure, and less encouragement for enquiry; and that a
      stranger, not knowing its language, has no ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This impediment, however, shall not stand in the way of <i>one</i>
      stranger, who is willing to offer up his national prejudices at the Altar
      of Truth, and expiate the crime of an unfounded but habitual antipathy, by
      an impartial examination, and an unbiassed inquiry. In short, I have
      actually began to study the language; and though I recollect to have read
      the opinion of Temple, &ldquo;that the Celtic dialect used by the native Irish
      is the purest and most original language that now remains yet I never
      suspected that a language spoken <i>par routine</i>, and chiefly by the
      lower classes of society, could be acquired upon <i>principle</i>, until
      the other day, when I observed in the Prince&rsquo;s truly national library some
      philological works, which were shown me by Father John, who has offered to
      be my preceptor in this wreck of ancient dialect, and who assures me he
      will render me master of it in a short time&mdash;provided I study <i>con
      amore</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will assist you,&rdquo; said Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will <i>all</i> assist him,&rdquo; said the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall study <i>con amore</i> indeed!&rdquo; returned I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold me then, buried amidst the monuments of past ages!&mdash;deep in
      the study of the language, history, and antiquities of this ancient nation&mdash;talking
      of the invasion of Henry II, as a recent circumstance&mdash;of the
      Phoenician migration hither from Spain, as though my grandfather had been
      delegated by Firbalgs to receive the Milesians on their landing&mdash;and
      of those transactions passed through
    </p>
    <p>

      &ldquo;The dark posterns of time long elapsed,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      as though their existence was but freshly registered in the annate of
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, infected by my antiquarian conversation with the Prince, and
      having fallen in with some of those monkish histories which, on the
      strength of Druidical tradition, trace a series of wise and learned Irish
      monarchs before the flood, I am beginning to have as much faith in
      antediluvian records as Dr. Parsons himself, who accuses <i>Adam of</i>
      authorship, or Thomas Bangius, who almost gives <i>fac similies</i> of the
      hand-writing of Noah&rsquo;s progenitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously, however, I enter on my new studies with avidity, and read from
      the morning&rsquo;s first dawn till the usual hour of breakfast, which is become
      to me as much the banquet of the heart, as the Roman supper was to the
      Agustan wits &ldquo;the feast of reason and the flow of soul,&rdquo;&mdash;for it is
      the only meal at which Glorvina presides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours each day does the kind priest devote to my philological
      pursuits, while Glorvina, who is frequently present on these occasions
      makes me repeat some short poem or song after her, that I may catch the
      pronunciation, (which is almost unattainable,) then translates them into
      English, which I word for word write down. Here then is a specimen of
      Irish poetry, which is almost always the effusion of some blind itinerent
      bard, or some rustic minstrel, into whose breast the genius of his country
      has breathed inspiration, as he patiently drove the plough, or laboriously
      worked in the bog. *

      &ldquo;My love, when she floats on the mountain&rsquo;s brow, is like the dewy cloud

      &ldquo;When she enters the forest like the bounding doe, dispersing the dew with
      her airy steps, her mantle on her arm, the axe in her hand to cut the

      the Saxons, ** or Cathbein Nolan.&rdquo;

     * Miss Brooks, in her elegant version of the works of some
     of the Irish Bards, says, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis scarcely possible that any
     language can be more adapted to lyric poetry than the Irish;
     so great is the smoothness and harmony of its numbers; it is
     also possessed of a refined delicacy, a descriptive power,
     and an exquisite tender simplicity of expression: two or
     three little artless words, or perhaps a single epithet,
     will sometimes convey such an image of sentiment or
     suffering to the mind, that one lays down the book to look
     at the picture.&rdquo;

     ** The King of England is called by the common Irish &ldquo;Riagh
     Sasseanach.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This little song is of so ancient a date, that Glorvina assures me,
      neither the name of the composer (for the melody is exquisitely beautiful)
      nor the poet, have escaped the oblivion of time. But if we may judge of
      the rank of the poet by that of his mistress, it must have been of a very
      humble degree; for it is evident that the fair Cathbein, whose form is
      compared, in splendour, to that of the Saxon monarch, is represented as
      cutting wood for the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following songs, however, are by the most celebrated of the modern
      Irish bards, Turloch Carolan, * and the airs to which he has composed
      them, possess the <i>arioso</i> elegance of Italian music, united to the
      heartfelt pathos of Irish melody.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * He was born in the village of Nobber, county of Westmeath,
     in 1670, and died in 1739. He never regretted the loss of
     sight, but used gaily to say, &ldquo;my eyes are only transplanted
     into my ears.&rdquo; Of his poetry, the reader may form some
     judgment from these examples. Of his music, it has been said
     by O&rsquo;Connor, the celebrated historian, who knew him
     intimately, &ldquo;so happy, so elevated was he in some of his
     compositions, that he excited the wonder, and obtained the
     approbation of a great master who never saw him, I mean
     Geminiani.&rdquo; His execution on the harp was rapid and
     expressive&mdash;far beyond that of all the professional
     competitors of the age in which he lived. The charms of
     women, the pleasures of conviviality, and the power of poesy
     and music, were at once his theme and inspiration; and his
     life was an illustration of his theory, for until his last
     ardour was chilled by death, he loved, drank and sung. He
     was a welcome guest to every house, from the peasant to the
     prince; but in the true wandering spirit of his profession,
     he never staid to exhaust that welcome.

     </p>
    <p>
      Does not this poetical effusion, awakened by the charms of the fair Gracy,
      recal to your memory the description of Helen by Theocritus, in his
      beautiful epithalamium on her marriage?&mdash;
    </p>

      &ldquo;She is like the rising of the golden morning, when the night departeth,

    <p>
      While the invocation to the enjoyment of convivial pleasure which breathes
      over the termination of every verse, glows with the festive spirit of the
      Tean bard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I remarked the coincidence of style, which existed between the early
      Greek writers and the bards of Erin, Glorvina replied, with a smile, &ldquo;In
      drawing this analogy, you think, perhaps, to flatter my national vanity;
      but the truth is, we trace the spirit of Milesian poetry to a higher
      source than the spring of Grecian genius; for many figures in Irish song
      are of Oriental origin; and the bards who ennobled the train of our
      Milesian founders, and who awakened the soul of song here, seem, in common
      with the Greek poets, &lsquo;to have kindled their poetic fires at those
      unextinguished lamps which burn within the tomb of oriental genius.&rsquo; Let
      me, however, assure you, that no adequate version of an Irish poem can be
      given; for the peculiar construction of the Irish language, the felicity
      of its epithets, and force of its expressions, bid defiance to all
      translation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But while your days and nights are thus devoted to Milesian literature,&rdquo;
       you will say, &ldquo;what becomes of Blackstone and Coke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faith, e&rsquo;en what may for me&mdash;the mind, the mind, like the heart, is
      not to be forced in its pursuits; and, I believe, in an intellectual, as
      in a physical sense, there are certain antipathies which reason may
      condemn, but not vanish. Coke is to me a dose of ipecacuhana; and my
      present studies, like those poignant incentives which stimulate the
      appetite without causing repletion. It is in vain to force me to a
      profession, against which my taste, my habits, my very nature revolts; and
      if my father persists in his determination, why, as a <i>dernier resort</i>,
      I must turn historiographer to the prince of Inismore.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he more I know of
      this singular girl, the more the happy <i>discordia consors</i> of her
      character awakens my curiosity and surprise. I never beheld such a union
      of intelligence and simplicity, infantine playfulness and profound
      reflection as her character exhibits. Sometimes when I think I am trifling
      with a child, I find I am conversing with a philosopher; and sometimes in
      the midst of the most serious and interesting conversation, some impulse
      of the moment seizes on her imagination, and a vein of frolic humour and
      playful sarcasm is indulged at the expense of my most sagacious arguments
      or philosophic gravity. Her reserve (unknown to herself) is gradually
      giving way to the most bewitching familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the priest is engaged, I am suffered to tread with her the &ldquo;pathless
      grass,&rdquo; climb the mountain&rsquo;s steep, or ramble along the sea-beat coast,
      sometimes followed by her nurse, and sometimes by a favourite little dog
      only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of nothing which concerns her country is she ignorant; and when a more
      interesting, a more soul-felt conversation, cannot be obtained, I love to
      draw her into a little national chit-chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, as we were walking along the base of that mountain from which I
      first beheld her dear residence, (and sure I may say with Petrarch,
      &ldquo;Benedetto sia il giorno e&rsquo;l mese e&rsquo;lanno,&rdquo;) several groups of peasants
      (mostly females,) passed us, with their usual courteous salutations, and
      apparently dressed in their holiday garbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor souls!&rdquo; said Glorvina&mdash;&ldquo;this is a day of jubilee to them, for a
      great annual fair is held in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But from whence,&rdquo; said I &ldquo;do they draw the brightness of those tints
      which adorn their coarse garments; those gowns and ribbons, that rival the
      gay colouring of that heath hedge; those bright blue and scarlet mantles?
      Are they, too, vestiges of ancient modes and ancient taste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly they are,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and the colours which the Irish were
      celebrated for wearing and dyeing a thousand years back, are now most
      prevalent. In short, the ancient Irish, like the Israelites, were so
      attached to this many coloured <i>costume</i>, that it became the mark by
      which the different classes of the people were distinguished. Kings were
      limited to seven colours in their royal robes; and six were allowed the
      bards. What an idea does this give of the reverence paid to superior
      talent in other times by our forefathers! But that bright yellow you now
      behold so universally worn, has been in all ages their favourite hue.
      Spenser thinks this custom came from the East; and Lord Bacon accounts for
      the propensity of the Irish to it, by supposing it contributes to
      longevity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do these poor people procure so expensive an article
      as saffron, to gratify their prevailing taste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard Father John say,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;that saffron, as an article
      of importation, could never have been at any time cheap enough for general
      use. And I believe formerly, as <i>now</i>, they communicated this bright
      yellow tinge with indigenous plants, with which this country abounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she added, springing lightly forward, and culling a plant which
      grew from the mountain&rsquo;s side&mdash;&ldquo;see this little blossom, which they
      call here, &lsquo;yellow lady&rsquo;s bed straw,&rsquo; and which you, as a botanist, will
      better recognize as the <i>Galieens borum</i>; it communicates a beautiful
      yellow; as does the <i>Lichen juniperinus</i>, or &lsquo;cypress moss,&rsquo; which
      you brought me yesterday; and I think the <i>résida Leuteola</i>, or
      &lsquo;yellow weed,&rsquo; surpasses them all.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Purple, blue, and green dyes, were introduced by Tighwmas
     the Great, in the year of the world 2814. The Irish also
     possessed the art of dyeing a fine scarlet; so early as the
     day of St. Bennia, a disciple of St. Patrick, scarlet
     clothes and robes high embroidered, are mentioned in the
     baok of Glandelogh.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short, the botanical treasures of our country, though I dare say
      little known, are inexhaustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she continued, observing, I believe, the admiration that sparkled
      in my eyes, &ldquo;give me no credit, I beseech you, for this local information,
      for there is not a peasant girl in the neighbourhood, but will tell you
      more on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus dispensing knowledge with the most unaffected
      simplicity of look and manner, a group of boys advanced towards us, with a
      car laden with stones, and fastened to the back of an unfortunate dog,
      which they were endeavouring to train to this new species of canine
      avocation, by such unmerciful treatment as must have procured the wretched
      animal a speedy release from all his sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina no sooner perceived this, than she flew to the dog, and while the
      boys looked all amaze, effected his liberation, and by her caresses,
      endeavoured to soothe him into forgetfulness of his late sufferings; then,
      turning to the ringleader, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dermot, I have so often heard you praised for your humanity to animals,
      that I can scarcely believe it possible that you have been accessory to
      the sufferings of this useful and affectionate animal; he is just as
      serviceable to society in his way, as you are in yours, and you are just
      as well able to drag a loaded cart as he is to draw that little car. Come
      now, I am not so heavy as the load you have destined him to bear, and you
      are much stronger than your dog, and now you shall draw me home to the
      castle; and then give me your opinion on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one moment his companions, laughing vociferously at the idea, had the
      stones flung out of the little vehicle, and fastened its harness on the
      broad shoulders of the half pouting, half smiling Dermot; and the next
      moment this little agile sylph was seated in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went Dermot, dragged on by the rest of the boys, while Glorvina,
      delighted as a child with her new mode of conveyance, laughed with all her
      heart, and kissed her hand to me as she flew along; while I, trembling for
      her safety, endeavoured to keep pace with her triumphal chariot, till her
      wearied, breathless Phaeton, unable to run any further with his lovely,
      laughing burthen, begged a respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;weary of this amusement, and yet you have not at every
      step been cruelly lashed like your poor dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The panting Dermot hung his head, and said in Irish, &ldquo;the like should not
      happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; said Glorvina, in the same language&mdash;&ldquo;we are all
      liable to commit a fault, but let us never forget it is in our power to
      correct it. And now go to the castle where you shall have a good dinner,
      in return for the good and pleasant exercise you have procured me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys were as happy as kings. Dermot was unyoked, and the poor dog,
      wagging his tail in token of his felicity, accompanied the gratified group
      to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Glorvina had translated to me the subject of her short dialogue with
      Dermot, she added, laughing, &ldquo;Oh! how I should like to be dragged about
      this way for two or three hours every day: never do I enter into any
      little folly of this kind, that I do not sigh for those sweet hours of my
      childhood when I could play the fool with impunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play the fool!&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;and do you call this playing the fool&mdash;this
      dispensation of humanity, this culture of benevolence in the youthful
      mind, these lessons of truth and goodness, so sweetly, so simply given?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;you always seem inclined to flatter me into
      approbation of myself! but the truth is, I was glad to seize on the
      opportunity of lecturing that urchin Dermot, who, though I praised his
      humanity, is the very beadle to all the unfortunate animals in the
      neighbourhood. But I have often had occasion to remark, that, by giving a
      virtue to these neglected children which they do not possess, I have
      awakened their emulation to attain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say that you are an angel,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is to say a very commonplace
      thing, which every man says to the woman he either does, or affects to
      admire; and yet&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo;&mdash;interrupted she, laying her hand on my arm, and looking up
      full in my face with that arch glance I have so often caught revelling in
      her eloquent eye&mdash;&ldquo;I am not emulous of a place in the angelic choir;
      canonization is more consonant to my <i>papistical</i> ambition; then let
      me be your saint&mdash;your tutelar saint, and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let me,&rdquo; interrupted I, impassionately, &ldquo;let me, like the members of
      the Greek church, adore my saint, not by prostration, but by a kiss;&rdquo;&mdash;and,
      for the first time in my life, I pressed my lips to the beautiful hand
      which still rested on my arm, and from which I first drew a glove that has
      not since left my bosom, nor been re-demanded by its charming owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This little freedom (which, to another, would have appeared nothing) was
      received with a degree of blushing confusion, that assured me it was the
      first of the kind ever offered; even the fair hand blushed its sense of my
      boldness, and enhanced the pleasure of the theft by the difficulty it
      promised of again obtaining a similar favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      By heaven there is infection in the sensitive delicacy of this creature,
      which even my hardened confidence cannot resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      No <i>prieux Chevalier</i>, on being permitted to kiss the tip of his
      liege lady&rsquo;s finger, after a seven years&rsquo; seige, could feel more
      pleasantly embarrassed than I did, as we walked on in silence, until we
      were happily relieved by the presence of the old garrulous nurse, who came
      out in search of her young lady&mdash;for, like the princesses in the
      Greek tragedies, <i>my</i> Princess seldom appears without the attendance
      of this faithful representative of fond maternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the walk she talked mostly to the nurse in Irish, and at
      the castle gate we parted&mdash;she to attend a patient, and I to retire
      to my own apartment, to ruminate on my morning&rsquo;s ram ble with this
      fascinating <i>lusus naturo</i>.

      has no great store) should soon be exhausted in the imitation, and I
      should have something more of her attention than she generally affords me
      at my drawing-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, in the absence of the priest, I read to her as she drew. After
      a thousand little symptoms of impatience and weariness&mdash;&ldquo;here,&rdquo; said
      she, yawning&mdash;&ldquo;here is a straight line I can make nothing of&mdash;do

      day and hour of my entrance into the castle; and in several places, the
      half defaced features of a face evidently a copy of my own, were still
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any thing could have rendered this little circumstance more deliciously
      gratifying to my heart, it was, that I had been just reading to her the
      anecdote of &ldquo;the <i>Maid of Corinth</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised my eyes from the paper to her with a look that must have spoken
      my feelings; but she, unconscious of my observation began a favourite air
      of her favourite Carolan&rsquo;s, and supposed me to be busy at the <i>perpendicular
      line</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapt in her charming avocation, she seemed borne away by the magic of her
      own numbers, and thus inspired and inspiring as she appeared, faithful, as
      the picture formed was interesting, I took her likeness. Conceive for a
      moment a form full of character, and full of grace, bending over an
      instrument singularly picturesque&mdash;a profusion of auburn hair
      fastened up to the top of the finest formed head I ever beheld, with a
      golden bodkin&mdash;an armlet of curious workmanship glittering above a
      finely turned elbow, and the loose sleeves of a flowing robe drawn up
      unusually high, to prevent this drapery from sweeping the chords of the
      instrument. The expression of the divinely touching countenance breathed
      all the fervour of genius under the influence of inspiration, and the
      contours of the face, from the peculiar uplifted position of the head,
      were precisely such, as lends to painting the happiest line of feature,
      and shade of colouring. Before I had near finished the lovely picture, her
      song ceased; and turning towards me, who sat opposite her, she blushed to
      observe how intensely my eyes were fixed on <i>her</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am admiring,&rdquo; said I, carelessly, &ldquo;the singular elegance of your
      costume: it is indeed to me a never failing source of wonder and
      admiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sorry,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;to avail myself of my father&rsquo;s prejudices
      in favour of our ancient national costume, which, with the exception of
      the drapery being made of modern materials (on the antique models,) is
      absolutely drawn from the wardrobes of my great grand dames. This armlet,
      I have heard my father say, is near four hundred years old, and many of
      the ornaments and jewels you have seen me wear, are of a date no less
      ancient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; said I, while she continued to tune her harp, and I to ply the
      pencil, &ldquo;how comes it that in so remote a period, we find the riches of
      Peru and Golconda contributing their splendour to the magnificence of
      Irish dress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she replied, smiling, &ldquo;we too had our Peru and Golconda in the bosom
      of our country&mdash;for it was once thought rich not only in gold and
      silver mines, but abounded in pearls, * amethysts, and other precious
      stones: even a few years back, Father John saw some fine pearls taken out
      of the river Ban; ** and Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, the celebrated Irish historian,
      declares that within his memory, amethysts of immense value were found in
      Ireland.&rdquo;! ***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;It should seem.&rdquo; says Mr. Walker, in his ingenious and
     elegant essay on Ancient Irish Dress&mdash;&ldquo;that Ireland teemed
     with gold and silver, for as well as in the laws recited, we
     find an act ordained 34th, Henry VIII, &lsquo;that merchant
     strangers should pay 40 pence custom for every pound of
     silver they carried out of Ireland; and Lord Stratford, in
     one of his letters from Dublin to his royal master, says,
     &lsquo;with this I land you an ingot of silver of 300 oz.&rsquo;&rdquo;

     ** Pearls abounded, and still are found in this country and
     were of such repute in the 11th century, that a present of
     them was sent to the famous Bishop Anselm, by a Bishop of
     Limerick.

     *** The author is indebted to Mr. Knox, barrister at law,
     Dublin, for the sight of some beautiful amethysts, which
     belonged to his female ancestors, and which many of the
     lapidaries of London, after a diligent search, found it
     impossible to match.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember reading in the life of St. Bridget, that the King of Leinster
      presented to her father a sword set with precious stones, which the pious
      saint, more charitable than honest, devoutly stole, and sold for the
      benefit of the poor; but it should seem that the sources of our national
      treasures are now shut up like the gold mines of La Valais, for the public
      weal, I suppose; for we now hear not of amethysts found, pearls
      discovered, or gold mines worked; and it is to the caskets of my female
      ancestors that I stand indebted that my dress or hair is not fastened or
      adorned like those of my humbler countrywomen, with a wooden bodkin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is a species of ornament I have observed very
      prevalent with your fair &lsquo;<i>paysannes</i>; and of whatever materials it
      is made, when employed in such a happy service as I <i>now</i> behold it,
      has an air of simple, useful elegance, which in my opinion constitutes the
      great art of female dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at least,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;the most ancient ornament we know here&mdash;for
      we are told that the celebrated palace of Emania, * erected previous to
      the Christian era, was sketched by the famous Irish Empress Macha, with
      the bodkin.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The resident palace of the Kings of Ulster, of which
     Colgan speaks as &ldquo;rendolens splendorum.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember a passage from a curious and ancient romance in the Irish
      language, that fastened wonderfully upon my imagination when I read it to
      my father in my childhood, and which gives to the bodkin a very early
      origin:&mdash;it ran thus, and is called the &lsquo;<i>Interview between Fionn
      M&rsquo;Cnmhal and Cannan</i>.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cannan, when he said this, was seated at table; on his right hand was
      seated his wife, and upon his left his beautiful daughter, so exceedingly
      fair, that the snow driven by the winter storms surpassed not her in
      fairness, and her cheeks wore the blood of a young calf; her hair hung in
      curling ringlets, and her teeth were like pearl&mdash;a spacious veil hung
      from her lovely head down her delicate form, and the veil was fastened by
      a goldenbodkin.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;The bodkin, you know, is also an ancient Greek
      ornament, and mentioned by Vulcan, as among the trinkets he was obliged to
      forge.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  See Iliad, 13, 17.
</pre>
    <p>
      By the time she had finished this curious quotation in favour of the
      antiquity of her dress, her harp was tuned, and she began another
      exquisite old Irish air called the &ldquo;Dream of the Young Man,&rdquo; which she
      accompanied rather by a plaintive <i>murmur</i>, than with her voice&rsquo;s
      full melodious powers. It is thus this creature winds round the heart,
      while she enlightens the mind, and entrances the senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had finished the sketch in the meantime, and just beneath the figure,
      and above her flattering inscription of my name, I wrote with my pencil,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas thus Apelles bask&rsquo;d in beauty&rsquo;s blaze,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Nor felt the danger of the steadfast gaze;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      while she, a few minutes after, with that restlessness that seemed to
      govern all her actions to-day arose, put her harp aside and approached me
      with, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Mortimer, you are very indulgent to my insufferable
      indolence&mdash;let me see what you have done for me;&rdquo; and looking over my
      shoulder, she beheld not the ruins of her castle, but a striking likeness
      of her blooming self; and sending her head close to the paper, read the
      lines, and that name honoured by the inscription of her own fair hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the world I would not have looked her full in the face; but from
      beneath my downcast eye I stole a transient glance: the colour did not
      rush to her cheek, (as it usually does under the influence of any powerful
      emotion) but rather deserted its beautiful standard, as she stood with her
      eyes riveted on the picture, as though she dreaded by their removal she
      should encounter those of the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about three minutes endurance of this mutual confusion, (could you
      believe me such a blockhead?) the priest, to our great relief, entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina ran and shook hands with him, as though she had not seen him in
      an age, and flew out of the room; while I effacing the quotation but not
      the honoured inscription, asked Father John&rsquo;s opinion of my effort at
      portrait painting. He acknowledged it was a most striking resemblance, and
      added, &ldquo;Now you will indeed give a <i>coup de grace</i> to the partiality
      of the Prince in your favour, and you will rank so much the higher in his
      estimation, in proportion as his daughter is dearer to him than his <i>ruins</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, I devoted the rest of the day to copying out this sketch:
      and I have finished the picture in that light tinting, so effective in
      this kind of characteristic drawings. That beautifully pensive expression
      which touches the countenance of Glorvina, when breathing her native
      strains, I have most happily caught; and her costume, attitude, and harp,
      form as happy a combination of traits, as a single portrait perhaps ever
      presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was shown to the Prince, he gazed on it in silence, till tears
      obscured his glance; then laying it down he embraced me, but said nothing.
      Had he detailed the merits of the picture in all the technical farago of
      <i>cognoscenti</i> phrase, his comments would not have been half so
      eloquent as this simple action, and the silence which accompanied it.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ere is a <i>bonne
      bouche</i> for your antiquarian taste, and <i>Ossianic</i> palate! Almost
      every evening after vesper, we all assemble in a spacious hall, * which
      had been shut up for near a century and first opened by the present prince
      when he was driven for shelter to his paternal ruins.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Amidst the ruins of Buan Ratha, near Limerick, is a
     princely hall and spacious chambers; the fine stucco in many
     of which is yet visible, though uninhabitable for near a
     century.&rdquo;&mdash;O&rsquo;Halloran&rsquo;s Introduction to the Study of the
     History and Antiquities of Ireland, p 8.

     In every town, every village, every considerable tract of
     land, the spacious ruins of princely residence or religious
     edifices, the palace, the castle, or the abbey, are to be
     seen.
</pre>
    <p>
      This <i>Vengolf</i>, this <i>Valkhalla</i>, where the very spirit of Woden
      seems to preside, runs the full length of the castle as it now stands (for
      the centre of the building only, has escaped the delapidations of time,)
      and its beautifully arched roof is enriched with numerous devices which
      mark the spirit of that day in which it was erected. This very curious
      roof is supported by two rows of pillars of that elegant spiral lightness
      which characterises the Gothic order in a certain stage of its progress.
      The floor is a finely tessellated pavement; and the ample but ungrated
      hearths which terminate it at either extremity, blaze every evening with
      the cheering contributions of a neighbouring bog. The windows which are
      high, narrow, and arched, command on one side a noble view of the ocean,
      on the other they are closed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I enquired of Father John the cause of this singular exclusion of a
      very beautiful landview, he replied, &ldquo;that from those windows were to be
      seen the greater part of that rich tract of land which once formed the
      territory of the Princes of Inismore; * and since,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the
      possessions of the present Prince are limited to a few hereditary acres
      and a few rented farms, he cannot bear to look on the domains of his ancestors
      nor ever goes beyond the confines of this little peninsula.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I understand that it is only a few years back, since the
     present respectable representatives of the M&rsquo;Dermot family
     opened those windows which the Prince of Coolavin closed up,
     upon a principle similar to that by which the Prince of
     Inismore was actuated.

      was once celebrated in all the boundless extravagance and convivial spirit
      of ancient Irish hospitality. But it now serves as an armory, a museum, a
      cabinet of national antiquities and national curiosities. In short, it is
      the receptacle of all those precious relics, which the Prince has been
      able to rescue from the wreck of his family splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, when he is seated by a blazing hearth in an immense arm-chair, made,
      as he assured me, of the famous wood of <i>Shilelah</i>, his daughter by
      his side, his harper behind him, and his <i>domestic altar</i> not
      destitute of that national libation which is no disparagement to princely
      taste, since it has received the sanction of imperial approbation; * his
      gratified eye wandering over the scattered insignia of the former prowess
      of his family; his gratified heart expanding to the reception of life&rsquo;s
      sweetest ties&mdash;domestic joys and social endearments;&mdash;he forgets
      the derangement of his circumstances&mdash;he forgets that he is the
      ruined possessor of a visionary title; he feels only that he is a man&mdash;and
      an Irishman! While the transient happiness that lights up the vehement
      feelings of his benevolent breast, effuses its warmth over all who come
      within its sphere.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Peter the Great, of Russia was fond of whiskey, and used
     to say, &ldquo;Of all wine, Irish wine is the best.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more delightful than the evenings passed in this <i>vengolf</i>&mdash;-this
      hall of Woden; where my sweet Glorvina hovers round us, like one of the
      beautiful <i>valkyries</i> of the Gothic paradise, who bestow on the
      spirit of the departed warrior that heaven he eagerly rushes on death to
      obtain. Sometimes she accompanies the old bard on her harp, or with her
      voice; and frequently as she sits at her wheel (for she is often engaged
      in this simple and primitive avocation,) endeavours to lure, her father to
      speak on those subjects most interesting to him or to me; or, joining the
      general conversation, by the playfulness of her humour, or the original
      whimsicality of her sallies, materially contributes to the &ldquo;<i>molle at
      que facetum!</i>&rdquo; of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the day of the picture-scene, the absence of Glorvina
      (for she was attending a sick servant) threw a gloom over our little
      circle. The Prince, for the first time, dismissed the harper, and taking
      me by the arm, walked up and down the hall in silence, while the priest
      yawned over a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already told you that this curious hall is the <i>emporium</i> of
      the antiquities of Inismore, which are arranged along its walls, and
      suspended from its pillars.&mdash;As much to draw the Prince from the
      gloomy reverie into which he seemed plunged, as to satisfy my own
      curiosity and yours, I requested his highness to explain some characters
      on a collar which hung from a pillar, and appeared to be plated with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having explained the motto, he told me that this collar had belonged to an
      order of knighthood hereditary in his family&mdash;of an institution more
      ancient than any in England, by some centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;was chivalry so early known in Ireland? and rather, did it
      ever exist here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it!&rdquo; said the Prince, impatiently, &ldquo;I believe, young gentleman, the
      origin of knighthood may be traced in Ireland upon surer ground than in
      any other country whatever.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran, with a great deal of spirit and ingenuity,
     endeavours to prove that the German Knighthood (the earliest
     we read of in chivalry) was of Irish origin; with what
     success we leave it to the impartial reader to judge. It is,
     however, certain, that the German ritter or knight, bears a
     very close analogy to the Irish riddaire. In 1394, Richard
     II, in his tour through Ireland, offered to knight the four
     provincial kings who came to receive him in Dublin. But they
     excused themselves, as having received that honour from
     their parents at seven years old&mdash;that being the age in
     which the kings of Ireland knighted their eldest sons.&mdash;See
     Froissart.
</pre>
    <p>
      Long before the birth of Christ, we had an hereditary order of knighthood
      in Ulster, called the Knights of the <i>Red Branch</i>. They possessed,
      near the royal palace of Ulster, a seat, called the <i>Academy of the Red
      Branch</i>; and an adjoining hospital, expressively termed the <i>House of
      the Sorrowful Soldier</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was also an order of chivalry hereditary in the royal families of
      Munster, named the <i>Sons of Deagha</i>, from a celebrated hero of that
      name, probably their founder. The Connaught knights were called the <i>Guardians
      of Jorus</i>, and those of Leinster, <i>the Clan of Boisgna</i>. So
      famous, indeed, were the knights of Iceland, for the elegance, strength,
      and beauty of their forms, that they were distinguished, by way of
      pre-eminence, by the name of <i>the Heroes of the Western Isle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our annals teem with instances of this romantic bravery and scrupulous
      honour. My memory, though much impaired, is still faithful to some
      anecdotes of both. During a war between the Connaught and Munster
      monarchs, in 192, both parties met in the plains of Lena, in this
      province; and it was proposed to Goll M&rsquo;Morni, chief of the Connaught
      Knights, to attack the Munstei army at midnight, which would have secured
      him victory. He nobly and indignantly replied: &lsquo;On the day the arms of a
      knight were put into my hands, I swore never to attack my enemy at night,
      by surprise, or under <i>any kind of disadvantage</i>; nor shall that vow
      now be broken.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides those orders of knighthood which I have already named, there are
      several others * still hereditary in noble families, and the honorable
      titles of which are still preserved: such as the <i>White Knights of Kerry</i>,
      and the <i>Knights of Glynn</i>: that hereditary in my family was the <i>Knights
      of the Valley</i>; and this collar, ** an ornament never dispensed with,
      was found about fifty years back in a neighbouring bog, and worn by my
      father till his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gorget,&rdquo; he continued, taking down one which hung on the wall, and
      apparently gratified by the obvious pleasure evinced in the countenance of
      his auditor,&mdash;&ldquo;This gorget was found some years after in the same
      bog.&rdquo; ***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The respectable families of the Fitzgeralds still bear the
     title of their ancestors, and are never named but as the
     Knights of Kerry and of Glynn.

     ** One of these collars was in the possession of Mr.
     O&rsquo;Halloran.

     *** In the Bog of Cullen, in the county of Tipperary, some
     golden gorgets were discovered, as were also some corslets
     of pure gold in the lands of Clonties, county of Kerry&mdash;-See
     Smith&rsquo;s History of Ireland.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this helmet?&rdquo; said I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is called in Irish,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;<i>salet</i> and belonged, with this
      coat of mail, to my ancestor who was murdered in this castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I coloured at this observation, as though I had been myself the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you refer, Sir,&rdquo; said the priest, who had flung by his book and joined
      us, &ldquo;to the ancient Irish for the origin of knighthood, * you will perhaps
      send us to the Irish <i>Mala</i>, for the derivation of the word mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  At a time when the footstep of an English invader had not
     been impressed upon the Irish coast, the celebrity of the
     Irish knights was sung by the British minstrels. Thus in the
     old romantic tale of Sir Cauline:=

      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said the national Prince, &ldquo;I should; but pray, Mr.
      Mortimer, observe this shield. It is of great antiquity. You perceive it
      is made of wicker, as were the Irish shields in general; although I have
      also heard they were formed of silver, and one was found near Slimore, in
      the county of Cork, plated with gold, which sold for seventy guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is a sword of curious workmanship, the hilt of which
      seems of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Cauline&rsquo;s antagonist, the Eldridge knight, is described as being &ldquo;a
      foul paymin&rdquo; which places the events, the romantic tale delineates, in the
      earliest era of Christianity in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in fact so,&rdquo; said the priest&mdash;&ldquo;Golden hilted swords have been
      in great abundance through Ireland; and it is a circumstance singularly
      curious, that a sword found in the bog of Cullen, should be of the exact
      construction and form of those found upon the plains of Canæ. You may
      suppose that the advocates of our Milesian origin gladly seize on this
      circumstance, as affording new arms against the sceptics to the antiquity
      of our nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here too is a very curious haubergeon, once perhaps impregnable! And this
      curious battle-axe,&rdquo; said I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was originally called,&rdquo; returned the Prince, &ldquo;<i>Tuath Catha</i>, or axe
      of war, and was put into the hands of our Galloglasses, or second rank of
      military.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how much more elegant,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;the form of this beautiful
      spear; it is of course of a more modern date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;this is the exact form of the cranuil
      or lance, with which Oscar is described to have struck Art to the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oscar!&rdquo; I repeated, almost starting&mdash;but added&mdash;&ldquo;O, true, Mr.
      Macpherson tells us the Irish have some wild improbable tales of Fingal&rsquo;s
      heroes among them, on which they found some claim to their being natives
      of this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some claim!&rdquo; repeated the Prince, and by one of those motions which speak
      more than volumes, he let go my arm, and took his usual station by the
      fireside, repeating, <i>some claim!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was thinking how I should repair my involuntary fault, the good
      natured priest said, with a smile, &ldquo;You know, my dear Sir, that by one
      half of his English readers, Ossian is supposed to be a Scottish bard of
      ancient days; by the other he is esteemed the legitimate offspring of
      Macpherson&rsquo;s own muse. But here,&rdquo; he added, turning to me, &ldquo;we are certain
      of his Irish origin, from the testimony of tradition, from proofs of
      historic fact, and above all, from the internal evidences of the poems
      themselves, even as they are given us by Mr. Macpherson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, who are from our infancy taught to recite them, who bear the
      appellations of their heroes to this day, and who reside amidst those very
      scenes of which the poems, even according to their <i>ingenious</i>, but
      not always <i>ingenuous</i> translator, are descriptive&mdash;<i>we</i>
      know, believe, and assert them to be translated from the fragments of the
      Irish bards, or seanachies, whose surviving works were almost equally
      diffused through the Highlands as through this country. Mr. Macpherson
      combined them in such forms as his judgment (too classically correct in
      this instance) most approved; retaining the old names and events, and
      altering the dates in his originals as well as their matter and form, in
      order to give them a higher antiquity than they really possess;
      suppressing many proofs which they contain of their Irish origin, and
      studiously avoiding all mention of St Patrick, whose name frequently
      occurs in the original poems; only occasionally alluding to him under the
      character of a <i>Culdee</i>; conscious that any mention of the <i>Saint</i>
      would introduce a suspicion that these poems were not the true
      compositions of Ossian, but those of <i>Fileas</i> who, in an after day,
      committed to verse the traditional details of one equally renowned in song
      and arms.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Samuir, daughter of Fingal, having married Cormac Cas,
     their son (says Keating) Modk Corb, retained as his friend
     and confidant his uncle Ossian, contrary to the orders of
     Cairbre Liffeachair, the then monarch, against whom the
     Irish militia had taken up arms. Ossian was consequently
     among the number of rebellious chiefs.
</pre>
    <p>
      Here, you will allow, was a blow furiously aimed at all my opinions
      respecting these poems, so long the objects of my enthusiastic admiration:
      you may well suppose I was for a moment quite stunned. However, when I had
      a little recovered, I went over the arguments used by Macpherson, Blair,
      &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., to prove that Ossian was a Highland bard, whose
      works were handed down to us by <i>oral</i> tradition, through a lapse of
      fifteen hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the priest, having patiently heard me out&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
      Macpherson confesses that the ancient language and traditional history of
      the Scottish nation became confined to the natives of the Highlands, who
      falling, from several concurring circumstances, into the last degree of
      ignorance and barbarism, left the Scots so destitute of historic facts,
      that they were reduced to the necessity of sending Fordun to Ireland for
      their history, from whence he took the entire first part of his book. For
      Ireland, owing to its being colonized from Phoenicia, and consequent early
      introduction of letters there, was at that period esteemed the most
      enlightened country in Europe: and indeed Mr. Macpherson himself avers,
      that the Irish, for ages antecedent to the Conquest, possessed a competent
      share of that kind of learning which prevailed in Europe; and from their
      superiority over the Scots, found no difficulty in imposing on the
      ignorant Highland seanachies, and establishing that historic system which
      afterwards, for want of any other, was universally received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear friend, if historic fact and tradition did not attest the
      poems of Ossian to be Irish, probability would establish it. For if the
      Scotch were obliged to Ireland, according to Mr. Macpherson&rsquo;s own account,
      not only for their history but their tradition, so remote a one as Ossian
      must have come from the Irish; for Scotland, as Dr. Johnson asserts, when
      he called on Mr. Macpherson to show his originals, had not an Erse
      manuscript two hundred years old. And Sir George M&rsquo;Kenzie, though himself
      a Scotchman, declares, &ldquo;that he had in his possession, an Irish manuscript
      written by Cairbre Lifteachair, * monarch of Ireland, who flourished
      before St Patrick&rsquo;s mission.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr O&rsquo;Halloran, in his Introduction to the study of Irish
     History, &amp;c.. quotes some lines from a poem still extant,
     composed by Torna Ligis, chief poet to Niai the Great, who
     flourished in the fourth century.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;even granting these beautiful poems to be the effusions of
      Irish genius, it is strange that the feats of your own heroes could not
      supply your bards with subjects for their epic verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange indeed it would have been,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and therefore they
      have chosen the most renowned chiefs in their annals of national heroism,
      as their Achilleses, their Hectors, and Agamemnons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;Is not Fingal a Caledonian chief? Is he not expressly
      called King of Morven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allowing he were in the originals, which he is not,&rdquo; returned the priest,
      &ldquo;give me leave to ask you where Morven lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose of course in Scotland,&rdquo; said I, a little unprepared for
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Macpherson supposes so too,&rdquo; replied he, smiling, &ldquo;though certainly
      he is at no little pains to discover where in Scotland. The fact is,
      however, that the epithet of <i>Riagh Mor Fhionne</i>, which Mr.
      Macpherson translates King of Morven, is literally King or Chief of the
      Fhians, or Fians, a body of men of whom Mr. Macpherson makes no mention,
      and which, indeed, either in the annals of Scottish history or Scottish
      poetry, would be vainly sought. Take then their history as extracted from
      the book of Howth into the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, in
      1786. *

     * Fionn, the son of Cumhal, [from whom, says Keating, the
     established militia of the kingdom were called Fion Erinne,]
     was first married to Graine, daguhter to Cormac, king of
     Ireland, and afterwards to her sister, and descended in a
     sixth degree from Nuagadh Neacht, king of Leinster. The
     history, laws, requisites, &amp;c., of the Fionna Erin, are to
     be found in Keating&rsquo;s History of Ireland, p. 269.

     Cormac, at the head of the Fion, and attended by Fingal,
     sailed to that part of Scotland opposite Ireland, where he
     planted a colony as an establishment for Carbry Riada, his
     cousin-german. This colony was often protected from the
     power of the Romans by the Fion, under the command of
     Fingal, occasionally stationed in the circumjacent country
     &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; says Walker, &ldquo;the claims of the Scots to Fin.&rdquo; In
     process of time this colony gave monarchs to Scotland, and
     their posterity at this day reign over the British empire.
     Fingal fell in an engagement at Rathbree, on the banks of
     the Boyne, A. D. 294; from whence the name of Rathbree was
     changed to Killeen, or Cill-Fhin, the tomb of Fin.

      &ldquo;In Ireland there were soldiers called <i>Fynne Erin</i>, appointed to
      keep the sea-coast, fearing foreign invasion, or foreign princes to enter
      the realm; the names of these soldiers were Fin M&rsquo;Cuil, Coloilon, Keilt,
      Oscar, M&rsquo;Ossyn, Dermot, O&rsquo;Doyne, Collemagh, Morna, and divers others.
      These soldiers waxed bold, as shall appear hereafter, and so strong, that
      they did contrary to the orders and institutions of the Kings of Ireland,
      their chiefs and governors, and became very strong and stout, and at
      length would do thing without license of the King of Ireland, &amp;c.,
      &amp;c&mdash;It is added, that one of these heroes was alive till the
      coming of St. Patrick, who recited the actions of his compeers to the
      Saint. This hero was Ossian, or, as we pronounce it, <i>Ossyn</i>; whose
      dialogues with the Christian missionary is in the mouth of every peasant,
      and several of them preserved in old Irish manuscripts. Now the Fingal of
      Mr. Macpherson (for it is thus he translates <i>Fin M&rsquo;Cuil</i>, sometimes
      pronounced and spelled Fionne M&rsquo;Cumhal, or <i>Fion</i> the son of Cumhal)
      and his followers appear like the earth-born myrmidons of Deucalion, for
      they certainly have no human origin; bear no connexion with the history of
      their country; are neither to be found in the poetic legend or historic
      record * of Scotland, and are even furnished with appellations which the
      Caledonians neither previously possessed nor have since adopted. They are
      therefore abruptly introduced to our knowledge as living in a barbarous
      age, yet endowed with every perfection that renders them the most refined,
      heroic, and virtuous of men. So that while we grant to the interesting
      poet and his heroes our boundless admiration, we cannot help considering
      them as solecisms in the theory of human nature.

     It is remarkable, that the genius of Ossianic style still
     prevails over the wild effusions of the modern and
     unlettered bards of Ireland; while even the remotest lay of
     Scottish minstrelsy respires nothing of that soul which
     breathes in &ldquo;the voice of Cona;&rdquo; and the metrical flippancy
     which betrays its existence, seems neither to rival, or cope
     with that touching sublimity of measure through whose
     impressive medium the genius of Ossian effuses its
     inspiration, and which, had it been known to ihe early bards
     of Scotland, had probably been imitated and adopted. In
     Ireland, it has ever been and is still the measure in which
     the Sons of Song breathe &ldquo;their wood notes wild.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;But with <i>us</i>, Fingal and his chiefs are beings of real existence,
      their names, professions, rank, characters, and feats, attested by
      historic fact as well as by poetic eulogium. Fingal is indeed romantically
      brave, benevolent, and generous, but he is turbulent, restless, ambitious:
      he is a man as well as a hero; and both his virtues and his vices bear the
      stamp of the age and country in which he lived. His name and feats, as
      well as those of his chief officers, bear an intimate connexion with our
      national history.

      &ldquo;Fionne, or Finnius, was the grandsire of Mile-sius; and it is not only a
      name to be met with through every period of our history, but there are few
      old families even at this day in Ireland, who have not the appellative of
      Finnius in some one or other of its branches; and a large tract of the
      province of Leinster is called <i>Fingal</i>; a title in possession of one
      of our most noble and ancient families.

      &ldquo;Nay, if you please, you shall hear our old nurse run through the whole

      exercise the memory of the peasant children.&rdquo; *
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I, nearly overpowered, &ldquo;Macpher-son assures us the Highlanders
      also repeat many of Ossian&rsquo;s poems in the original Erse: nay, that even in
      the Isle of Sky, they still show a stone which bears the form and name of
      Cuchullin&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo; **

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * They run it over thus: Oscar Mac Ossyn, Mac Fion, MacCuil,
     Mac Cormic, Mac Arte, Mac Fiervin, &amp;c., &amp;c. That is, Oscar
     the son of Ossian, the son of Fion, &amp;c.

     ** There is an old tradition current in Connaught, of which
     Bran, the favourite dog of Ossian is the hero. In a war
     between the king of Lochlin and the Fians, a battle
     continued to be fought on equal terms for so long a period,
     that it was at last mutually agreed that it should be
     decided in a combat between Ossian&rsquo;s Bran and the famous
     Cudubh, or dark greyhound, of the Danish monarch. This
     greyhound had already performed incredible feats, and was
     never to be conquered until his name was found out. The
     warrior dogs fought in a space between the two armies, and
     with such fury, says the legend, in a language absolutely
     untranslatable, that they tore up the stony bosom of the
     earth, until they rendered it perfectly soft, and again
     trampled on it with such force, that they made it of a rocky
     substance. The Cudubh had nearly gained the victory, when
     the baldheaded Conal, turning his face to the east, and
     biting his thumb, a ceremony difficult to induce him to
     perform, and which always endowed him with the gift of
     divination, made a sudden exclamation of encouragement to
     Bran, the first word of which found the name of the
     greyhound, who lost at once his prowess and the victory.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the most flagrant error of all,&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince, abruptly
      breaking his sullen silence&mdash;&ldquo;for he has scynchronized heroes who
      flourished in two distant periods; both Cuchullin and Conal Cearneath are
      historical characters with us; they were Knights of the <i>Red Branch</i>,
      and flourished about the birth of Christ. Whereas Fingal, with whom he has
      united them, did not flourish till near three centuries after. It is
      indeed Macpherson&rsquo;s pleasure to inform us that by the Isle of Mist is
      meant the Isle of Sky, and on that circumstance alone to rest his claim on
      <i>Cuchullin&rsquo;s</i> being a Caledonian; although, through the whole poems
      of Fingal and Temora, he is not once mentioned as such; it is by the
      translator&rsquo;s notes only we are informed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; said the priest&mdash;&ldquo;that in the first mention made of
      <i>Cuchullin</i> in the poem of Fingal, he is simply denominated &lsquo;the son
      of Se-mo,&rsquo; &lsquo;the Ruler of High Temora,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mossy Tura&rsquo;s Chief.&rsquo;&rdquo; * So called,
      says Macpherson, from his castle on the coast of Ulster, where he dwelt
      before he took the management of the affairs of Ireland into his hands;
      though the singular cause which could induce the lord of the Isle of Sky
      to reside in Ireland previous to his political engagements in the Irish
      state, he does not mention.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The groves of Tura, or Tuar, are often noticed in Irish
     song. Emunh Acnuic, or Ned of the Hill, has mentioned it in
     one of his happiest and most popular poems. It was supposed
     to be in the county of Armagh, province of Ulster.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the same manner we are told, that his <i>three</i> nephews came from
      Streamy Etha, one of whom married an Irish lady; but there is no mention
      made of the real name of the place of their nativity, although the
      translator assures us in another note, that they also were Caledonians.
      But, in fact, it is from the internal evidences of the poems themselves,
      not from the notes of Mr. Macpherson, nor indeed altogether from his
      beautiful but unfaithful translation, that we are to decide on the nation
      to which these poems belong. In Fingal, the first and most perfect of the
      collection, that hero is first mentioned by Cuchullin as Fingal, <i>King
      of Desarts</i>&mdash;in the original&mdash;-<i>Inis na bf hiodhuide</i>,
      or <i>Woody Island</i>; without any allusion whatever to his being a
      Caledonian. And afterwards he is called King of Selma, by Swaran, a name,
      with little variation given to several castles in Ireland. Darthula&rsquo;s
      castle is named Selma; and another, whose owner I do not remember, is
      termed Selemath. <i>Slimora</i>, to whose fir the spear of Foldath is
      compared, is a mountain in the province of Munster, and through out the
      whole, even of Mr. Macpherson&rsquo;s translation, the characters, names,
      allusions, incidents and scenery are all Irish. And in fact, <i>our Irish
      spurious ballads</i>, as Mr. Macpherson calls them, are the very originals
      out of which he has spun the materials for his version of Ossian. *
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Johnson, who strenuously opposed the idea of <i>Ossian</i> being the
      work of a Scotch bard of the third century, asserts that the &lsquo;Erse never
      was a written language, and that there is not in the world a written Erse
      manuscript a hundred years old.&rsquo; He adds, &lsquo;The Welsh and Irish are
      cultivated tongues, and two hundred years back insulted their English
      neighbours for the instability of their orthography.&rsquo; Even the ancient
      Irish <i>letter</i> was unknown in the Highlands in 1690, for an Irish
      version of the Bible being given there by Mr. Kirk, was printed in the
      Roman character.

     called Alt Ossoin, surrounded by all that wild sublimity of
     scenery so exquisitely deliniated through the elegant medium
     of Macpherson&rsquo;s translation of Ossian; and in its environs

     many stories and sonnets&mdash;as of the giants Fin, Mac Huyle,

      number of Gællic poems respecting the race of the Fiens, so renowned in
      the annals of Irish heroism, * and found, that the orthography was less
      pure than that among us; for, he says, &ldquo;the Erse being only a written
      language within these few years, no means were yet afforded of forming a
      decided orthographic standard.&rdquo; But he augurs, from the improvement which
      had lately taken place, that we soon may expect to see the Erse restored
      to the original purity which it possesses in the <i>mother</i> country.
      And these very poems, whence Mr. Macpherson has chiefly constructed his
      Ossian, bear such strong internal proof of their Irish origin, as to
      contain in themselves the best arguments that can be adduced against the
      Scottish claimants on the poems of the bard. But in their translation, **

     that these militia were called Fine, from Fion Mac Cum-hal;
     but it is certainly a great error; the word fine, strictly
     implying a military corps. Many places in the island retain
     to this day the names of some of the leaders of this body of
     men, and whole volumes of poetical fictions have been
     grafted upon their exploits. The manuscripts which I have,
     after giving a particular account of Finn&rsquo;s descent, his
     inheritance, his acquisitions from the king of Leinster and
     his great military command, immediately adds, &lsquo;but the
     reader must not expect to meet here with such stories of him
     and his heroes as the vulgar Irish have.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Warner.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;when you read to me a description of a sea
      fight between Fingal and Swaran, in Macpherson&rsquo;s translation, that I
      repeated to you, in Irish, the very poem whence it was taken, and which is
      still very current here, under the title of <i>Laoid Mhanuis M&rsquo;hoir</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned the priest, &ldquo;a copy of which is deposited in the
      University of Dublin, with another Irish MS. entitled, &lsquo;<i>Oran cadas
      Ailte agus do Maronnan</i>&rsquo; whence the battle of Lora is taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince then, desiring Father John to give him down a bundle of old
      manuscripts which lay on a shelf in the hall dedicated to national tracts,
      after some trouble produced a copy of a poem, called &ldquo;The Conversation of
      Ossian and St. Patrick,&rdquo; the original of which, Father John assured me,
      was deposited in the library of the Irish University.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to this poem that Mr. Macpherson alludes, when he speaks of the
      dispute reported to have taken place between Ossian and a Culdee.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my request he translated this curious controversial tract. The dispute
      was managed on both sides with a great deal of polemic ardour. St.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick, with apostolic zeal, shuts the gates of mercy on all whose faith
      differs from his own, and, with an unsaintly vehemence extends the
      exclusion in a pointed manner, to the ancestors of Ossian, who, he
      declares, are suffering in the <i>limbo</i> of tortured spirits. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Notwithstanding the sceptical obstinacy that Ossian here
     displays, there is a current tradition of his having been
     present at a baptismal ceremony performed by the Saint, who
     accidentally struck the sharp point of his crozier through
     the bard&rsquo;s foot, who, supposing it part of the ceremony,
     remained transfixed to the earth without a murmer.
</pre>
    <p>
      The bard tenderly replies, &ldquo;It is hard to believe thy tale, O man of the
      white book! that Fion, <i>or one so generous</i>, should be in captivity
      with God or man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, however, the saint persists in the assurance, that not even the
      generosity of the departed hero could save him from the house of torture,
      the failing spirit of &ldquo;the King of Harps&rdquo; suddenly sends forth a lingering
      flash of its wonted fire; and he indignantly declares, &ldquo;that if the Clan
      of Boisgno were still in being, they would liberate their beloved general
      from this threatened hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Saint, however, growing warm in the argument, expatiates on the great
      difficulty of <i>any</i> soul entering the court of God: to which the
      infidel bard beautifully replies:&mdash;&ldquo;Then he is not like <i>Fionn
      M&rsquo;Cuil</i>, or chief of the Fians; for every man upon the earth might
      enter <i>his</i> court without asking his permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you perceive, fairly routed, I however artfully proposed terms of
      capitulation, as though my defeat was yet dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were I a Scotchman,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should be furnished with more effectual
      arms against you; but as an Englishman, I claim an armed neutrality, which
      I shall endeavour to preserve between the two nations. At the same time
      that I feel the highest satisfaction in witnessing the just pretentions of
      that country (which now ranks in my estimation next to my own) to a work
      which would do honour to <i>any</i> country so fortunate as to claim its
      author as her son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, who seemed highly gratified by this avowal, shook me heartily
      by the hand, apparently flattered by his triumph; and at that moment
      Glorvina entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, my dear!&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;you are just come in time to witness an
      amnesty between Mr. Mortimer and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should much rather witness the amnesty than the breach,&rdquo; returned she,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been battling about the country of Ossian,&rdquo; said the priest,
      &ldquo;with as much vehemence as the claimants on the birthplace of Homer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! I know of old,&rdquo; cried Glorvina, &ldquo;that you and my father are natural
      allies on that point of contention; and I must confess, it was ungenerous
      in both to oppose your united strength against Mr. Mortimer&rsquo;s single
      force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then,&rdquo; said the Prince, good humouredly, &ldquo;I suppose you would have
      deserted your national standard, and have joined Mr. Mortimer, merely from
      motives of compassion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Glorvina, faintly blushing, &ldquo;but I should have
      endeavoured to have compromised between you. To you I would have accorded
      that Ossian was an Irishman, of which I am as well convinced as of any
      other self-evident truth whatever, and to Mr. Mortimer I would have
      acknowledged the superior merits of Mr. Macpherson&rsquo;s poems, as
      compositions, over those wild effusions of our Irish bards, whence he
      compiled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long before I could read, I learned on the bosom of my nurse, and in my
      father&rsquo;s arms, to recite the songs of our national bards, and almost since
      I could read, the Ossian of Macpherson has been the object of my
      enthusiastic admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the original Irish poems, if my fancy is sometimes dazzled by the
      brilliant flashes of native genius, if my heart is touched by the strokes
      of nature, or my soul elevated by sublimity of sentiment, yet my interest
      is often destroyed, and my admiration often checked, by relations so
      wildly improbable, by details so ridiculously grotesque, that though these
      stand forth as the most undeniable proofs of their authenticity and the
      remoteness of the day in which they were composed, yet I reluctantly
      suffer my mind to be convinced at the expense of my feeling and my taste.
      But in the soul-stealing strains of &lsquo;the Voice of Cona,&rsquo; as breathed
      through the refined medium of Macpherson&rsquo;s genius, no incongruity of
      style, character, or manner disturbs the profound interest they awaken.
      For my own part, when my heart is coldly void, when my spirits are sunk
      and drooping, I fly to my English Ossian, and then my sufferings are
      soothed, and every desponding spirit softens into a sweet melancholy, more
      delicious than joy itself; while I experience in its perusal a similar
      sensation as when, in the stillness of an autumnal evening, I expose my
      harp to the influence of the passing breeze, which faintly breathing on
      the chords, seems to call forth its own requiem as it expires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Macpherson!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;be thy spirit appeased, for thou hast
      received that apotheosis thy talents have nearly deserved, in the eulogium
      of beauty and genius, and from the lip of an Irishwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This involuntary and impassioned exclamation extorted from the Prince a
      smile of gratified parental pride, and overwhelmed Glorvina with
      confusion. She could, I believe, have spared it before her father, and
      received it with a bow and a blush. Shortly after she left the room.

    <h3>
      LETTER XIII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he conduct of this
      girl is inexplicable. Since the unfortunate picture scene three days back,
      she has excused herself twice from the drawing desk; and to-day appeared
      at it with the priest by her side. Her playful familiarity is vanished,
      and a chill reserve, uncongenial to the native ardour of her manner has
      succeeded. Surely she cannot be so vain, so weak, as to mistake my
      attentions to her as a young and lovely woman, my admiration of her
      talents, and my surprise at the originality of her character, for a
      serious passion. And supposing me to be a wanderer and a hireling, affect
      to reprove my temerity by haughtiness and disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you credit it! by Heavens, I am sometimes weak enough to be on the
      very point of telling her who and what I am, when she plays off her little
      airs of Milesian pride and female superciliousness. You perceive,
      therefore, by the conduct of this little Irish recluse, that on the
      subject of love and vanity, woman is everywhere, and in all situations the
      same. For what coquette reared in the purlieus of St. James&rsquo;s, could be
      more a <i>portée</i> to those effects which denote the passion, or more
      apt to suspect she had awakened it into existence, than this
      inexperienced, unsophisticated being! who I suppose never spoke to ten men
      in her life, save the superanuated inhabitants of her paternal ruins.
      Perhaps, however, she only means to check the growing familiarity of my
      manner, and to teach me the disparity of rank which exists between us;
      for, with all her native strength of mind, the influence of invariable
      example and precept has been too strong for her, and she has unconsciously
      imbibed many of her father&rsquo;s prejudices respecting antiquity of descent
      and nobility of birth. She will frequently say, &ldquo;O! such a one is a true
      Milesian!&rdquo;&mdash;or, &ldquo;he is a descendant of the <i>English</i> Irish;&rdquo; or,
      &ldquo;they are new people&mdash;we hear nothing of them till the wars of
      Cromwell,&rdquo; and so on. Yet at other times, when reason lords it over
      prejudice, she will laugh at that weakness in others, she sometimes
      betrays in herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other day, as we stood chatting at a window together, pointing to an
      elderly man who passed by, she said, &ldquo;there goes a poor Connaught
      gentleman, who would rather starve than work&mdash;he is a <i>follower</i>
      of the family and has been just entertaining my father with an account of
      our ancient splendour. We have too many instances of this species of <i>mania</i>
      among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The celebrated Bishop of Cloyne relates an anecdote of a kitchen-maid,
      who refused to carry out cinders, because she was of Milesian descent. And
      Father John tells a story of a young gentleman in Limerick, who, being
      received under the patronage of a nobleman going out as governor general
      of India, sacrificed his interest to his <i>national pride</i>; for having
      accompanied his lordship on board of the vessel which was to convey them
      to the East, and finding himself placed at the foot of the dining table,
      he instantly arose, and went on shore, declaring that &lsquo;as a <i>true
      Milesian</i>, he would not submit to any indignity, to purchase the riches
      of the East India Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; continued Glorvina, &ldquo;is ridiculous, nay, it is worse, for it
      is highly dangerous and fatal to the community at large. It is the source
      of innumerable disorders, by promoting idleness, and consequently vice. It
      frequently checks the industry of the poor, and limits the exertions of
      the rich, and perhaps is not among the least of those sources whence our
      national miseries flow. At the same time, I must own, I have a very high
      idea of the virtues which exalted birth does or ought to bring with it.
      Marmontel elegantly observes, &lsquo;nobility of birth is a letter of credit
      given us on our country, upon the security of our ancestors, in the
      conviction that at a proper period of life we shall acquit ourselves with
      honour to those who stand engaged for us.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Observe, that this passage was quoted in the first person, but not, as in
      the original, in the second, and with an air of dignity that elevated her
      pretty little head some inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;we are all the beings of education, and that its
      most material branch, example, lies vested in our parents, it is natural
      to suppose that those superior talents or virtues which in early stages of
      society are the purchase of worldly elevation, become hereditary, and that
      the noble principles of our ancestors should descend to us with their
      titles and estates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;these are the ideas of an Irish Princess, reared
      in the palace of her ancestors on the shores of the Atlantic ocean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may be,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;the ideas of an inexperienced recluse, but I
      think they are not less the result of rational supposition, strengthened
      by the evidence of internal feeling; for though I possessed not that
      innate dignity of mind which instinctively spurned at the low suggestion
      of vicious dictates, yet the consciousness of the virtues of those from
      whom I am descended, would prevent me from sullying by an unworthy action
      of mine, the unpolluted name I had the honour to bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then repeated several anecdotes of the heroism, rectitude, and virtue
      of her ancestors of both sexes, adding, &ldquo;this was once the business of our
      Bards, Fileas, and Seanachps; but we are now obliged to have recourse to
      our own memories, in order to support our own dignity. But do not suppose
      I am so weak as to be dazzled by a <i>sound</i>, or to consider mere title
      in any other light than as a golden toy judiciously worn to secure the
      respect of the vulgar, who are incapable of appreciating that &lsquo;which
      surpassed show,&rsquo; * which, as my father says, is sometimes given to him who
      saves, and sometimes bestowed on him who betrays his country. O! no; for I
      would rather possess <i>one</i> beam of that genius which elevates <i>your</i>
      mind above all worldly distinction, and those principles of integrity
      which breathe in your sentiments and ennoble your soul, than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;He feels no ennobling principles in his own heart, who
     wishes to level all the artificial institutes which have
     been adopted for giving body to opinion, and per manence to
     future esteem.&rdquo;&mdash;Burke.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus hurried away by the usual impetuosity of her feelings, she abruptly
      stopped, fearful, perhaps, that she had gone too far. And then, after a
      moment added&mdash;&ldquo;but who will dare to bring the soul&rsquo;s nobility in
      competition with the shortlived elevation which man bestows on man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first direct compliment she ever paid me; and I received it
      with a silent bow, a throbbing heart, and a colouring cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is she not an extraordinary creature! I meant to have given you an
      unfavourable opinion of her prejudices; and in transcribing my documents
      of accusation, I have actually confirmed myself in a better opinion of her
      heart and understanding than I ever before indulged in. For to think well
      of <i>her</i>, is a positive indulgence to my philanthropy, after having
      thought so ill of all her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her virtues and her genius have nothing to do with the ice which
      crystalizes round her heart; and which renders her as coldly indifferent
      to the talents and virtues with which her fancy has invested me, as though
      they were in possession of a hermit of fourscore. Yet, God knows, nothing
      less than cold does her character appear. That mutability of complexion
      which seems to flow perpetually to the influence of her evident feelings
      and vivid imagination, that ethereal warmth which animates her manners;
      the force and energy of her expressions, the enthusiasm of her
      disposition, the uncontrollable smile, the involuntary tear, the
      spontaneous sigh!&mdash;Are these indications of an icy heart? And yet,
      shut up as we are together, thus closely associated, the sympathy of our
      tastes, our pursuits! But the fact is, I begin to fear that I have
      imported into the shades of Inismore some of my London presumption: and
      that, after all, I know as little of this charming <i>sport of Nature</i>,
      as when I first beheld her&mdash;possibly my perceptions have become as
      sophisticated as the objects to whom they have hitherto been directed; and
      want refinement and subtilty to enter into all the delicate <i>minutiae</i>
      of her superior and original character, which is at once both <i>natural</i>
      and <i>national</i>. Adieu!

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o day I was
      present at an interview granted by the Prince to two contending parties,
      who came to <i>ask law of him</i>, as they term it. This, I am told, the
      Irish peasantry are ready to do upon every slight difference; so that they
      are the most litigious, or have the nicest sense of <i>right</i> and <i>justice</i>
      of any people in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the language held by this little judicial meeting was Irish, it
      was by no means necessary it should be understood to comprehend, in some
      degree, the subject of discussion; for the gestures and countenances both
      of the judge and the clients were expressive beyond all conception: and I
      plainly understood, that almost every other word on both sides was
      accompanied by a species of <i>local oath</i>, sworn on the first object
      that presented itself to their hands, and strongly marked the vehemence of
      the national character.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I took notice of this to Father John, he replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain, that the habit of confirming every assertion with an oath,
      is as prevalent among the Irish as it <i>was</i> among the ancient, and <i>is</i>
      among the modern Greeks. And it is remarkable, that even at this day, in
      both countries, the nature and form of their adjurations and oaths are
      perfectly similar: a Greek will still swear by his parents, or his
      children; an Irishman frequently swears &lsquo;by my father, who is no more!&rsquo;
      &lsquo;by my mother in the grave!&rsquo; Virgil makes his pious Æneas swear by his
      head. The Irish constantly swear &lsquo;by my hand,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;by this hand,&rsquo;&mdash;or,
      &lsquo;by the hand of my gossip!&rsquo; * There is one who has just sworn by <i>the
      Cross</i>; another by the blessed stick he holds in his hand. In short, no
      intercourse passes between them where confidence is required, in which
      oaths are not called in to confirm the transaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The mention of this oath recalls to my mind an * anecdote
     of the bard Carolan, as related by Mr. Walker, in his
     inimitable Memoir of the Irish Bards. &ldquo;He (Carolan) went
     once on a pilgrimage to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Purgatory, a cave in
     an island in Lough Dergh, (county of Donegal) of which more
     wonders are told than even the Cave of Triphonius. On his
     return to shore, he found several pilgrims waiting the
     arrival of the boat, which had conveyed him to the object of
     his devotion. In assisting some of those devout travellers
     to get on board, he chanced to take a lady&rsquo;s hand, and
     instantly exclaimed &lsquo;dar lamh mo Chardais Criost, [i. e. by
     the hand of my gossip] this is the hand of Bridget Cruise.&rsquo;
     His sense of feeling did not deceive him&mdash;it was the hand of
     her who he once adored.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I am at this moment returned from my <i>Vengolf,</i> after having declared
      the necessity of my absence for some time, leaving the term, however,
      indefinite; so that in this instance, I can be governed by my inclination
      and convenience, without any violation of promise. The good old Prince
      looked as much amazed at my determination, as though he expected I were
      never to depart; and I really believe, in the old fashioned hospitality of
      his Irish heart, he would be better satisfied I never should. He said many
      kind and cordial things in his own curious way; and concluded by pressing
      my speedy return, and declaring that my presence had created a little
      jubilee among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was absent; and Glorvina, who sat at her little wheel by her
      father&rsquo;s side, snapped her thread, and drooped her head close to her work,
      until I casually observed, that I had already passed above three weeks at
      the castle&mdash;then she shook back the golden tresses from her brow, and
      raised her eyes to mine with a look that seemed to say, &ldquo;can that be
      possible!&rdquo; Not even by a glance did I reply to the flattering question;
      but I felt it not the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arose to retire to our respective apartments, and I mentioned that
      I should be off at dawn, the Prince shook me cordially by the hand, and
      bid me farewell with an almost paternal kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina, on whose arm he was leaning, did not follow his example&mdash;she
      simply wished me &ldquo;a pleasant journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;do you sojourn to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the town of Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which has
      been hitherto my head quarters, and where I have left my clothes, books,
      and drawing utensils. I have also some friends in the neighbourhood,
      procured me by letters of introduction with which I was furnished in
      England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You know that a great part of this neighbourhood is my father&rsquo;s property,
      and once belonged to the ancestors of the Prince. He changed colour as I
      spoke, and hurried on in silence.

    <p>
      Adieu! the castle clock strikes twelve! What creatures we are! when the
      tinkling of a bit of metal can affect our spirits. Mine, however, (though
      why, I know not,) were prepared for the reception of sombre images. This
      night may be, in all human probability, the last I shall sleep in the
      castle of Inismore; and what then&mdash;it were perhaps as well I had
      never entered it. A generous mind can never reconcile itself to the
      practices of deception; yet to prejudices so inveterate, I had nothing but
      deception to oppose. And yet, when in some happy moment of parental
      favour, when all my past sins are forgotten, and my present state of
      regeneration only remembered&mdash;I shall find courage to disclose my
      romantic adventure to my father, and through the medium of that strong
      partiality the son has awakened in the heart of the Prince, unite in bonds
      of friendship these two worthy men but <i>unknown</i> enemies&mdash;then I
      shall triumph in my impositions, and, for the first time, adopt the maxim,
      that good consequences may be effected by means not strictly conformable
      to the rigid laws of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just been at my window, and never beheld so gloomy a night&mdash;not
      a star twinkles through the massy clouds that are driven impetuously along
      by the sudden gusts of a rising storm&mdash;not a ray of light partially
      dissipates the profound obscurity, save what falls on a fragment of an
      opposite tower, and seems to issue from the window of a closet which joins
      the apartment of Glorvina. She has not yet then retired to rest, and yet
      &rsquo;tis unusual for her to sit up so late. For I have often watched
      that little casement&mdash;its position exactly corresponds with the angle
      of the castle where I am lodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I should have any share in the vigils of Glorvina!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not whether to be most gratified or hurt at the manner in which she
      took leave of me. Was it indifference, or resentment, that marked her
      manner? She certainly was surprised, and her surprise was not of the most
      pleasing nature&mdash;for where was the magic smile, the sentient blush,
      that ever ushers in and betrays every emotion of her ardent soul! Sweet
      being! whatever may be the sentiments which the departure of the supposed
      unfortunate wanderer awakens in thy bosom, may that bosom still continue
      the hallowed asylum of the dove of peace! May the pure heart it enshrines
      still throb to the best impulses of the happiest nature, and beat with the
      soft palpitation of innocent pleasure and guileless transport, veiled from
      the rude intercourse of that world to which thy elevated and sublime
      nature is so eminently superior; long amidst the shade of the venerable
      ruins of thy forefathers mayest thou bloom and flourish in undisturbed
      felicity! the ministering angel of thy poor compatriots, who look up to
      thee for example and support&mdash;thy country&rsquo;s muse, and the bright
      model of the genuine character of her daughters, when unvitiated by
      erroneous education and by those fatal prejudices which lead them to seek
      in foreign refinements for those talents, those graces, those virtues
      which are no where to be found more flourishing, more attractive than in
      their native land.

      requires less nicety of perception to distinguish differences in kind than
      differences in degree; but though my present, like my past situation, is
      solitudinous in the extreme, it demands no very great discernment to
      discover that my late life was a life of solitude&mdash;my present, of
      desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the castle of Inismore I was estranged from the world: here I am
      estranged from myself. Yet so much more sequestered did that sweet
      interesting spot appear to me, that I felt, on arriving at this vast and
      solitary place (after having passed by a few gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, and caught
      a distant view of the little town of Bally&mdash;&mdash;,) as though I
      were returning to the world&mdash;but felt as if that world had no longer
      any attraction for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a dream was the last three weeks of my life! But it was a dream from
      which I wished not to be awakened. It seemed to me as if I had lived in an
      age of primeval virtue. My senses at rest, my passions soothed to
      philosophic repose, my prejudices vanquished, all the powers of my mind
      gently breathed into motion, yet calm and unagitated&mdash;all the
      faculties of my taste called into exertion, yet unsated even by boundless
      gratification.&mdash;My fancy restored to its pristine warmth, my heart to
      its native sensibility. The past given to oblivion, the future
      unanticipated, and the present enjoyed with the full consciousness of its
      pleasurable existence. Wearied, exhausted, satiated by a boundless
      indulgence of hackneyed pleasures, hackneyed occupations, hackneyed
      pursuits, at a moment when I was sinking beneath the lethargic influence
      of apathy, or hovering on the brink of despair, a new light broke upon my
      clouded mind, and discovered to my inquiring heart, something yet worth
      living for. What that mystic something is, I can scarcely yet define
      myself; but a magic spell now irresistibly binds me to that life which but

      The reserved tints of a gray dawn had not yet received the illuminating
      beams of the east, when I departed from the castle of Inismore. None of
      the family were risen, but the hind who prepared my <i>rosinante</i>, and
      the nurse, who made my breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rode twice round that wing of the castle where Glorvina sleeps: the
      curtain of her bedroom casement was closely drawn: but as I passed by it a
      second time, I thought I perceived a shadowy form at the window of the
      adjoining casement. As I approached it seemed to retreat; the whole,
      however, might have only been the vision of my wishes&mdash;my <i>wishes!!</i>
      But this girl piques me into something of interest for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three miles from the castle, on the summit of a wild and desolate
      heath, I met the good Father Director of Inismore. He appeared quite
      amazed at the rencontre. He expressed great regret at my absence from the
      castle, insisting that he should accompany me a mile or two of my journey,
      though he was only then returning after having passed the night in
      ministering temporal as well as spiritual comfort to an unfortunate family
      at some miles distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These poor people,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;were tenants on the skirts of Lord M&rsquo;s
      estate, who, though by all accounts a most excellent and benevolent man,
      employs a steward of a very opposite character. This unworthy delegate
      having considerably raised the rent on a little farm held by these
      unfortunate people, they soon became deeply in arrears, were ejected, and
      obliged to take shelter in an almost roofless hut, where the inclemency of
      the season, and the hardships they endured, brought on disorders by which
      the mother and two chil dren are now nearly reduced to the point of death;
      and yesterday, in their last extremity, they sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I commiserated the sufferings of these unfortunates (and cursed the
      villain Clendinning in my heart,) I could not avoid adverting to the
      humanity of this benevolent priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These offices of true charity, which you so frequently perform,&rdquo; said I,
      &ldquo;are purely the result of your benevolence, rather than a mere observance
      of your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have no parish; but the incumbent of that in
      which these poor people reside is so old and infirm, as to be totally
      incapacitated from performing such duties of his-calling as require the
      least exertion. The duty of one who professes himself the minister of
      religion, whose essence is charity, should not be confined within the
      narrow limitation of prescribed rules; and I should consider myself as
      unworthy of the sacred habit I wear, should my exertions be confined to
      the suggestions of my interest and my duty only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The faith of the lower order of Catholics here in their priest,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;is astonishing: even his presence they conceive is an antidote
      to every evil.&mdash;When he appears at the door of their huts, and blends
      his cordial salutation with a blessing, the spirit of consolation seems to
      hover at its threshhold&mdash;pain is alleviated, sorrow soothed; and
      hope, rising from the bosom of strengthening faith, triumphs over the
      ruins of despair. To the wicked he prescribes penitence and confession,
      and the sinner is forgiven; to the wretched he asserts, that suffering
      here, is the purchase of felicity hereafter, and he is resigned; and to
      the sick he gives a consecrated charm, and by the force of faith and
      imagination he is made well.&mdash;Guess then the influence which this
      order of men hold over the aggregate of the people; for while the Irish
      peasant, degraded, neglected, despised, * vainly seeks one beam of
      conciliation in the eye of overbearing superiority; condescension,
      familiarity and kindness win his gratitude to him whose spiritual
      elevation is in his mind above all temporal rank.&rdquo;
     </p>

     * &ldquo;The common people of Ireland have no rank in society&mdash;
     they may be treated with contempt, and consequently are with
     inhumanity.&rdquo;&mdash;An Enquiry into the Causes, &amp;c.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a patriarchal interest over the character of
      priesthood among you here; which gives that order to my view in a very
      different aspect from that in which I have hitherto considered it. To what
      an excellent purpose might, this boundless influence be turned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; interrupted he, &ldquo;priests <i>were not men</i>&mdash;men too,
      generally speaking, without education, (which is in fact, character,
      principle, everything) except such as tends rather to narrow than enlarge
      the mind&mdash;men in a certain degree shut out from society, except of
      the lower class; and men who, from their very mode of existence (which
      forces them to depend on the eleemosynary contributions of their flock,)
      must eventually in many instances imbibe a degradation of spirit which is
      certainly not the parent of the liberal virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said I, surprised, &ldquo;and this from one of their own order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are sentiments I never should have hazarded,&rdquo; returned the priest,
      &ldquo;could I not have opposed to those natural conclusions, drawn from well
      known facts, innumerable instances of benevolence, piety, and learning
      among the order. While to the whole body let it be allowed as <i>priests</i>,
      whatever may be their failings as <i>men</i>, that the activity of their
      lives, * the punctilious discharge of their duty, and their ever ready
      attention to their flock, under every moral and even under every physical
      suffering, renders them deserving of that reverence and affection which,
      above the ministers of any other religion, they receive from those over
      whom they are placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  &ldquo;A Roman Catholic clergyman is the minister of a very
     ritual religion; and by his profession, subject to many
     restraints; his life is full of strict observances, and his
     duties are of a laborious nature towards himself, and of the
     highest possible trust towards others.&rdquo;&mdash;Letter on the
     Penal Laws against the Irish Catholics, by the Right
     Honourable Edmund Burke.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if opposed to the languid performance of periodical
      duties, neglect of the moral functions of their calling, and the habitual
      indolence of the ministers of other sects, they may certainly be deemed
      zealots in the cause of the faith they profess, and the charity they
      inculcate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I spoke, a young lad, almost in a state of nudity, approached us;
      yet in the crown of his leafless hat were stuck a few pens, and over his
      shoulder hung a leathern satchel full of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an apposite rencontre,&rdquo; said the priest&mdash;&ldquo;behold the first
      stage of <i>one</i> class of Catholic priesthood among us; a class however
      no longer very prevalent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy approached, and, to my amazement, addressed us in Latin, begging
      with all the vehement eloquence of an Irish mendicant, for some money to
      buy ink and paper. We gave him a trifle, and the priest desired him to go
      on to the castle, where he would get his breakfast, and that on his return
      he would give him some books into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, who solicited in Latin, expressed his gratitude in Irish; and we
      trotted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; said Father John, &ldquo;formerly was the frequent origin of our Roman
      Catholic priests This is a character unknown to you in England, and is
      called here &lsquo;<i>a poor scholar</i>.&rsquo; If a boy is too indolent to work and
      his parents too poor to support him, or, which is more frequently the
      case, if he discovers some natural talents, or, as they call it, <i>takes
      to his learning</i>, and that they have not the means to forward his
      improvement, he then becomes by profession a <i>poor scholar</i>, and
      continues to receive both his mental and bodily food at the expense of the
      community at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a leathern satchel on his back, containing his portable library, he
      sometimes travels not only through his own province, but frequently over
      the greater part of the kingdom. * No door is shut against the poor
      scholar, who, it is supposed, at a future day may be invested with the
      apostolic key of Heaven. The priest or schoolmaster of every parish
      through which he passes, receives him for a few days into his barefooted
      seminary, and teaches him bad Latin and worse English; while the most
      opulent of his schoolfellows eagerly seize on the young peripatetic
      philosopher and provide him with maintenance and lodging; and if he is a
      boy of talent or <i>humour</i> (a gift always prized by the naturally
      laughter-loving Milesians) they will struggle for the pleasure of his
      society.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It has been justly said, that, &ldquo;nature is invariable in
     her operations; and that the principles of a polished people
     will influence even their latest posterity.&rdquo; And the ancient
     state of letters in Ireland, may be traced in the love of
     learning and talent even still existing among the inferior
     class of the Irish to this day. On this point it is observed
     by Mr. Smith, in his History of Kerry, &ldquo;that it is well
     known that classical reading extends itself even to a fault,
     among the lower and poorer kind of people in this country,
     [Munster,] many of whom have greater knowledge in this way
     than some of the better sort in other places. He elsewhere
     observes, that Greek is taught in the mountainous parts of
     the province. And Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran asserts, that classical
     reading has most adherents in those retired parts of the
     kingdom where strangers had least access, and that as good
     classical scholars were found in most parts of Connaught, as
     in any part of Europe.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having thus had the seeds of dependence sown <i>irradically</i> in his
      mind, and furnished his perisatetic studies, he returns to his native
      home, and with an empty satchel to his back, goes about raising
      contributions on the pious charity of his poor compatriots: each
      contributes some necessary article of dress, and assists to fill a little
      purse, until completely equipped; and, for the first time in his life,
      covered from head to foot, the divine embryo sets out for some sea-port,
      where he embarks for the colleges of Douay or St. Omer&rsquo;s; and having
      begged himself, <i>in forma pauperis</i>, through all the necessary rules
      and discipline of the seminary, he returns to his own country, and becomes
      the minister of salvation to those whose generous contributions enable him
      to assume the sacred profession. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The French Revolution, and the foundation of the Catholic
     college at Maynooth, has put a stop to these pious

      &ldquo;Such is the man by whom the minds opinions, and even actions of the
      people are often influenced; and, if man is but a creature of education
      and habit, I leave you to draw the inference. But this is but <i>one</i>
      class of priesthood, and its description rather applicable to twenty or
      thirty years back than to the present day. The other two may be divided
      into the sons of tradesmen and farmers, and the younger sons of Catholic
      gentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the latter order am I; and the interest of my friends on my return
      from the continent procured me what was deemed the best parish in the
      diocese. But the good and the evil attendant on every situation in life,
      is rather to be estimated by the feelings and sensibility of the objects
      whom they affect, than by their own intrinsic nature. It was in vain I
      endeavoured to accommodate my mind to the mode of life into which I had
      been forced by my friends. It was in vain I endeavoured to assimilate my
      spirit to that species of exertion necessary to be made for my livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To owe my subsistence to the precarious generosity of those wretches,
      whose every gift to me must be the result of a sensible deprivation to
      themselves; be obliged to extort (even from the altar where I presided as
      the minister of the Most High) the trivial contributions for my support,
      in a language which, however appropriate to the understandings of my
      auditors, sunk me in my own esteem to the last degree of self-degradation;
      or to receive from the religious affection of my flock such voluntary
      benefactions as, under the pressure of scarcity and want, their rigid
      economy to themselves enabled them to make to the pastor whom they
      revered. * In a word, after three years miserable dependence on those for
      whose poverty and wretchedness my heart bled, I threw up my situation, and
      became chaplain to the Prince of Inismore, on a stipend sufficient for my
      little wants, and have lived with him for thirty years, on such terms as
      you have witnessed for these three weeks back.

     * &ldquo;Are these men supposed to have no sense of justice that,

     establishment exclusively, they should be called on to pay

     they should pay a pound to our clergymen; that, while they
     can scarce afford their own a horse, they should place ours
     in his carriage; and that when they cannot build a mass-

      &ldquo;While my heart felt compassion, my tenderest sympathy is given to those
      of my brethren who are by birth and education divested of that scale of
      thought, and obtuseness of feeling, which distinguish those of the order,
      who, reared from the lowest origin upon principles the most servilizing,
      are callous to the innumerable humiliations of their dependent state&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here an old man mounted on a mule, rode up to the priest, and with tears
      in his eyes informed him that he was just going to the castle to humbly
      entreat his reverence would visit a poor child of his, who had been looked
      on with &ldquo;<i>an evil eye</i>,&rdquo; a few days back, * and who had ever since
      been pining away.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is supposed among the lower order of Irish, as among
     the Greeks, that some people are born with an evil eye,
     which injures every object on which it falls, and they will
     frequently go many miles out of their direct road, rather
     than pass by the house of one who has &ldquo;an evil eye.&rdquo; To
     frustrate its effects, the priest hangs a consecrated charm
     around the necks of their children, called &ldquo;a gospel;&rdquo; and
     the fears of the parents are quieted by their faith.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was our misfortune,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;never to have tied a gospel about her
      neck, as we did round the other children&rsquo;s, or this heavy sorrow would
      never have befallen us. But we know if your reverence would only be
      pleased to say a prayer over her, all would go well enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest gave me a significant look, and shaking me cordially by the
      hand, and pressing my speedy return to Inismore, rode off with the
      suppliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in his duty, &ldquo;prompt at every call,&rdquo; after having passed the night
      in acts of religious benevolence, his humanity willingly obeyed the voice
      of superstitious prejudice which endowed him with the fancied power of
      alleviating fancied evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I rode along, reflecting on the wondrous influence of superstition, and
      the nature of its effects, I could not help dwelling on the strong analogy
      which in so many instances appears between the vulgar errors of this
      country and that of the ancient as well as modern Greeks.
    </p>
    <p>

      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> wish you were to
      have seen the look with which the worthy Mr. Clendinning met me, as I rode
      up the avenue to M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put an end at once to his impertinent surmises, curiosity, and
      suspicion, which I evidently saw lurking in his keen eye, I made a display
      of my fractured arm, which I still wore in a sling; and naturally enough
      accounted for my absence, by alleging that a fall from my horse, and a
      fractured limb had obliged me to accept the humane attentions of a
      gentleman, near whose house the accident had happened, and whose guest and
      patient I had since been. Mr. Clendinning affected the tone of regret and
      condolence, with some appropriate suppositions of what his lord would feel
      when he learnt the unfortunate circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a word, Mr. Clendinning,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I do not choose my father&rsquo;s
      feelings should be called in question on a matter which is now of no ill
      consequence; and as there is not the least occasion to render him unhappy
      to no purpose, I must insist that you neither write nor mention the
      circumstance to him on any account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clendinning bowed obedience, and I contrived to ratify his promise by
      certain inuendoes; for, as he is well aware many of his villanies have
      reached my ear, he hates and fears me with all his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first inquiry was for letters. I found two from my father, and one,
      only one, from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father writes in his usual style. His first is merely an epistle
      admonitory; full of prudent axioms, and fatherly solicitudes. The second
      informs me that his journey to Ireland is deferred for a month or six
      weeks, on account of my brother&rsquo;s marriage with the heiress of the richest
      banker in the city. It is written in his best style, and a brilliant flow
      of spirit pervades every line. In the plenitude of his joy all <i>my</i>
      sins are forgiven; he even talks of terminating my exile sooner than I had
      any reason to suspect: and he playfully adds, &ldquo;of changing my banishment
      into slavery&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;knowing from experience that provided my shackles are
      woven by the rosy fingers of beauty, I can wear them patiently and
      pleasurably enough. In short,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;I have a connexion in my eye, for
      you, not less brilliant in point of fortune than that your brother has
      made; and which will enable you to forswear your Coke, and burn your
      Blackstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the spirit of matrimonial establishment seems to have taken such
      complete possession of my speculating <i>dad</i>, that it would by no
      means surprise me though he were on the point of sacrificing at the
      Hymenial altar himself. You know he has more than once, in a frolic,
      passed for my elder brother; and certainly has more sensibility than
      should belong to <i>forty-five</i>. Nor should I at all wonder if some
      insinuating coquette should one day or other <i>sentimentalize</i> him
      into a Platonic passion, which would terminate <i>in the old way</i>. I
      have, however, indulged in a little triumph at his expense, and have
      answered him in a strain of apathetic content&mdash;that habit and reason
      have perfectly reconciled me to my present mode of life, which leaves me
      without a wish to change it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for your letter. With respect to the advice you demand, I have only to
      repeat the opinion already advanced that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; But with
      respect to that you give me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Go bid physicians preach our veins to health,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And with an argument new set a pulse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And as for your prediction&mdash;of this be certain, that I am too
      hackneyed in <i>les affaires du cour</i>, ever to fall in love beyond all
      redemption with any woman in existence. And even this little Irish girl,
      with all her witcheries, is to me a subject of philosophical analysis,
      rather than amatory discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask me if I am not disgusted with her brogue? If she had one, I doubt
      not but I should? but the accent to which we English apply that term, is
      here generally confined to the lower orders of society; and I certainly
      believe, that purer and more grammatical English is spoken generally
      through Ireland than in any part of England whatever; for here you are
      never shocked by the barbarous unintelligible dialect peculiar to each
      shire in England. As to Glorvina, an aptitude to learn languages is, you
      know, peculiar to her country; but in her it is a decided and striking
      talent: even her Italian is, &ldquo;<i>la lingua Toscana nel bocca Romana,&rdquo;</i>
      and her English, grammatically correct, and elegantly pure, is spoken with
      an accent that could never denote her country. But it is certain, that in
      <i>that</i> accent there is a species of langour very distinct from the
      brevity of ours. Yet (to me at least) it only renders the lovely speaker
      more interesting. A simple question from her lip seems rather tenderly to
      solicit, than abruptly to demand. Her every request is a soft
      supplication; and when she stoops to entreaty, there is in her voice and
      manner such an energy of supplication, that while she places <i>your</i>
      power to grant in the most ostensible light to yourself, you are
      insensibly vanquished by that soft persuasion whose melting meekness
      bestows your fancied exaltation. Her sweet-toned mellifluous voice, is
      always sighed forth rather below than above its natural pitch, and her
      mellowed, softened, mode of articulation is but imperfectly expressed by
      the <i>susaro susingando</i>, or <i>coaxy murmurs</i> of Italian
      persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Father John, who is the first and most general linguist I ever met, she
      stands highly indebted; but to Nature, and her own ambition to excel,
      still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now but six hours in this solitary and deserted mansion, where I feel
      as though I reigned the very king of desolation. Let me hear from you by
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu.

    <h3>
      LETTER XVII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> forgot to mention
      to you in my last, that to my utter joy and surprise, our <i>premier</i>
      here has been recalled. On the day of my return, he received a letter from
      his lord, desiring his immediate attendance in London, with all the rents
      he could collect; for I suppose the necessary expenditure requisite for my
      brother&rsquo;s matrimonial establishment, will draw pretty largely on our
      family treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change of things in our domestic politics has changed all my plans of
      operation. This arch spy being removed, obviates the necessity of my
      retreat to the Lodge. My establishment here consists only of two females,
      who scarcely speak a word of English; an old gardener, who possesses not
      one <i>entire sense</i>, and a groom, who, having nothing to do, I shall
      discharge: so that if I should find it my pleasure to return and remain
      any time at the castle of Inismore, I shall have no one here to watch my
      actions, or report them to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something Boeotian in this air. I can neither read, write, or
      think. Does not Locke assert, that the soul sometimes dozes? I frequently
      think I have been bit by a torpedo, or that I partake in some degree of
      the nature of the seven sleepers, and suffer a transient suspension of
      existence. What if this Glorvina has an <i>evil eye</i>, and has
      overlooked me? The witch haunts me, not only in my dreams, but when <i>I
      fancy myself</i> at least, awake. A thousand times I think I hear the
      tones of her voice and harp. Does she feel my absence at the accustomed
      hour of tuition, the fire-side circle in the <i>Vengolf</i> the twilight
      conversation, the noontide ramble?&mdash;Has my presence become a want to
      her? Am I missed, and missed with regret? It is scarcely vanity to say, <i>I
      am&mdash;I must be</i>. In a life of so much sameness, the most trivial
      incident, the most inconsequent character obtains in interest in a certain
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I caught her weeping over a pet robin, which died on her bosom.
      She smiled, and endeavoured to hide her tears. &ldquo;This is very silly I
      know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but one must feel even the loss of a <i>bird</i> that
      has been the <i>companion of one&rsquo;s solitude!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To-day I flung down my book in downright deficiency of comprehension to
      understand a word in it, though it was a simple case in the Reports of
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-; and so, in the most <i>nonchalante</i> mood
      possible, I mounted my <i>rosinante</i>, and throwing the bridle over her
      neck, said, &ldquo;please thyself;&rdquo; and it was her pious pleasure to tread on
      consecrated ground: in short, after a ride of half an hour, I found myself
      within a few paces of the parish mass-house, and recollected that it was
      the Sabbath day; so that you see my mare reproved me, though in an oblique
      manner, with little less gravity than the ass of Balaam did his obstinate
      rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mass-house was of the same order of architecture as the generality of
      Irish cabins, with no other visible mark to ascertain its sacred
      designation than a stone cross, roughly hewn, over its entrance. I will
      not say that it was merely a sentiment of piety which induced me to enter
      it; but it certainly required, at first, an effort of energy to obtain
      admittance, as for several yards round this simple tabernacle a crowd of
      <i>devotees</i> were prostrated on the earth, praying over their beads
      with as much fervour as though they were offering up their orisins in the
      golden-roofed temple of Soliman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had fastened my horse&rsquo;s bridle to a branch of a hawthorn, I
      endeavoured to make my way through the pious crowd, who all arose the
      moment I appeared&mdash;for the <i>last mass</i>, I learned, was over, and
      those who had prayed <i>par hazard</i>, without hearing a word the priest
      said within, departed. While I pressed my way into the body of the chapel,
      it was so crowded that with great difficulty I found means to fix myself
      by a large triangular stone vessel filled with holy water, where I
      fortunately remained (during the sermon) unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sermon was delivered by a little old mendicant, in the Irish
      language. Beside him stood the parish priest in pontifiealibus, and with
      as much self-invested dignity as the <i>dalai lama</i> of Little Thibet
      could assume before his votarists. When the shrivelled little mendicant
      had harangued them some time on the subject of Christian charity, for so
      his countenance and action indicated, a general <i>secula seculorum</i>
      concluded his discourse; and while he meekly retreated a few paces, the
      priest mounted the steps of the little altar; and after preparing his
      lungs, he delivered an oration, to which it would be impossible to do any
      justice. It was partly in Irish, partly in English; and intended to
      inculcate the necessity of contributing to the relief of the mendicant
      preacher, if they hoped to have the benefit of his prayers; addressing
      each of his flock by their name and profession, and exposing their faults
      and extolling their virtues, according to the nature of their
      contributions While the friar, who stood with his face to the wall, was
      with all human diligence piously turning his beads to two accounts&mdash;with
      one half he was making intercession for the souls of his good subscribers,
      and with the other diligently keeping count of the sum total of their
      benefactions. As soon as I had sent in mine, almost stifled with heat, I
      effected my escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrasting this parish priest with the chaplain of Inismore, I could
      not help exclaiming with Epaminondas&mdash;&ldquo;It is the <i>man</i> who must
      give dignity to the situation&mdash;not the situation to the man.&rdquo; Adieu.

    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La solitude est certainement une belle chose, mais il-y-a plaisir d&rsquo;avoir
      quelqu&rsquo;une qui en sache repondre, a qui on puis dire, la solitude est une
      belle chose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>o says Monsieur de
      Balsac, and so repeats my heart a thousand times a day. In short, I am
      devoured by <i>ennui</i>, by apathy, by discontent! What should I do here?
      Nothing. I have spent but four days here, and all the symptoms of my old
      disease begin to re-appear: in short, like other impatient invalids, I
      believed my cure was effected when my disease was only on the decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must again fly to sip from the fountain of intellectual health at
      Inismore, and receive the vivifying drops from the hand of the presiding
      priestess, or stay here, and fall into an incurable atrophy of the heart
      and mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having packed up a part of my wardrobe, and a few books, I sent them by a
      young rustic to the little <i>Villa di Marino</i>, and in about an hour
      after I followed myself. The old fisherman and his dame seemed absolutely
      rejoiced to see me, and having laid my valise in their cabin, and
      dismissed my attendant, I requested they would permit their son to carry
      my luggage as far as the next <i>cabaret</i>, where I expected a man and
      horse to meet me. They cheerfully complied, and I proceeded with my <i>compagnon
      de voyage</i> to a hut which lies half way between the fisherman&rsquo;s and the
      castle. This hut they call a <i>Sheebin House</i>, and is something
      inferior to a certain description of Spanish inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a little board informs the weary traveller he is only to expect
      &ldquo;good dry lodgings,&rdquo; yet the landlord contrives to let you know in an <i>entre
      nous</i> manner, that he keeps some real <i>Inishone</i>, (or spirits,
      smuggled from a tract of country so called) for his particular friends. So
      having dismissed my second courier, and paid for the whiskey I did not
      taste, and the potatoes I did not eat, I sent my host forward, mounted on
      a sorry mule, with my travelling equipage, to the cabin at the foot of the
      drawbridge; and by these precautions obviated all possibility of
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I now proceeded on my route, every progressive step awakened some new
      emotion; while my heart was agitated by those unspeakable little
      flutterings which are alternately excited and governed by the ardour of
      hope, or the timidity of fear. &ldquo;And shall I, or shall I not be welcome?&rdquo;
       was the problem which engaged my thoughts during the rest of my little
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I descended the mountain, at whose base the peninsula of Inismore
      reposes, I perceived a form at some distance, whose drapery (&ldquo;<i>ne bulam
      lineam</i>&rdquo;) seemed light as the breeze on which it floated. It is
      impossible to mistake the figure of Glorvina, when its graces are called
      forth by motion. I instantly alighted, and flew to meet her. She too
      sprang eagerly forward. We were almost within a few paces of each other,
      when she suddenly turned back and flew down the hill with the bounding
      step of a fawn. This would have mortified another&mdash;I was charmed. And
      the bashful consciousness which repelled her advances, was almost as
      grateful to my heart as the warm impulse which had nearly hurried her into
      my arms.&mdash;How freshly does she still wear the first gloss of nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, however, I perceived her return, leaning on the arm of
      the Father Director. You cannot conceive what a festival of the feelings
      my few days absence had purchased me. Oh! he knows nothing of the doctrine
      of enjoyment, who does not purchase his pleasure at the expense of
      temporary restraint. The good priest, who still retains something of the
      etiquette of his foreign education, embraced me <i>a la Française</i>.
      Glorvina, however, who <i>malhereusement</i>, was not reared in France,
      only offered me her <i>hand</i>, which I had not the courage to raise to
      my unworthy lip, although the cordial <i>cead mille a falta</i> of her
      country revelled in her shining eyes, and and her effulgent countenance
      was lit up with an unusual blaze of animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the castle the Prince sent for me to his room, and told
      me, as he pressed my hand, that &ldquo;his heart warmed at my sight.&rdquo; In short,
      my return seems to have produced a carnival in the whole family.
    </p>
    <p>
      You who know, that notwithstanding my late vitiated life, the simple
      pleasures of the heart were never dead to mine, may guess how highly
      gratifying to my feelings is this interest, which, independent of all
      adventitious circumstances of rank and fortune, I have awakened in the
      bosoms of these cordial, ingenuous beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late insufferable reserve of Glorvina has given way to the most
      bewitching (I had almost said <i>tender</i>) softness of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I descended from paying my visit to the Prince, I found her and the
      priest in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are waiting for you,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;there is no resisting the
      fineness of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as we left the door, she pointed towards the west and added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The weary sun hath made a golden set,

    <p class="indent15">
      And by yon ruddy brightness of the clouds,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Gives tokens of a goodly day to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! apropos, Mr. Mortimer, you are returned in most excellent time&mdash;for
      to-morrow is the <i>first of May</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is the arrival of a guest,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;on the <i>eve</i> of that day a
      favourable omen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arrival of such a guest,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;must be at least ominous of
      happiness. But the first of May is our great national festival; and you,
      who love to trace modern customs to ancient origins, will perhaps feel
      some curiosity and interest to behold some of the rites of our heathen
      superstitions still lingering among our present ceremonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have you, like the Greeks, the festivals of the
      spring among you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;that the ancient Irish sacrificed on
      the <i>first of May to Beal</i>, or the <i>Sun</i>; and that day, even at
      this period, is called <i>Beal</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this idolatry to the god of Light and Song,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;one would almost
      suppose that Apollo was the tutelar deity of your island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;Hecatæus tells us that the Hyperborean Island was
      dedicated to Apollo, and that most of its inhabitants were either priests
      or bards, and I suppose you are not ignorant that we claim the honour of
      being those happy Hyperboreans, which were believed by many to be a
      fabulous nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the peculiar favour of the god of Poetry and Song may be esteemed
      a sufficient proof, it is certain that our claims are not weak. For surely
      no nation under heaven was ever more enthusiastically attached to poetry
      and music than the Irish. Formerly every family had its poet or bard,
      called Filea Crotaire; and, indeed, the very language itself, seems most
      felicitously adapted to be the vehicle of poetic images; for its energy,
      strength, expression, and luxuriancy, never leave the bard at a loss for
      apposite terms to realize &lsquo;the thick coming fancies of his genius.&rsquo;&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran informs us, that in a work entitled
     &ldquo;Uiraceacht na Neaigios,&rdquo; or Poetic Tales, above an hundred
     different species of Irish verse is exhibited. O&rsquo;Molloy, in
     his Irish and Latin Grammar, has also given rules and
     specimens of our modes of versification, which may be seen
     in Dr. Linud&rsquo;s Achaeologia.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Glorvina, &ldquo;the first of May was not the only festival held
      sacred by the Irish to their tutelar deity; on the 24th of June they
      sacrificed to the Sun, to propitiate his influence in bringing the fruit
      to perfection; and to this day those lingering remains of heathen rites
      are performed with something of their ancient forms. &lsquo;<i>Midsummer&rsquo;s Night</i>,&rsquo;
      as it is called, is with us a night of universal lumination&mdash;the
      whole country olazes: from the summit of every mountain, every hill,
      ascends the flame of the bonfire, while the unconscious perpetuators of
      the heathen ceremony dance round the fire in circles, or holding torches
      to it made of straw, run with the burning brands wildly through the
      country with all the gay frenzy of so many Bacchantes. But though I adore
      our aspiring <i>Beal</i> with all my soul, I worship our popular deity <i>Samhuin</i>
      with all my heart&mdash;he is the god of the heart&rsquo;s close knitting
      socialities, for the domesticating month of November is sacred to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on its eve,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;the great fire of <i>Samhuin</i> was
      illuminated, all the culinary fires in the kingdom being first
      extinguished, as it was deemed sacrilege to awaken the winter&rsquo;s social
      flame, except by a spark snatched from this sacred fire, * and so deep
      rooted are the customs of our forefathers among us, that the present Irish
      have no other name for the month of November than <i>Samhuin</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * To this day, the inferior Irish look upon bonfires as
     sacred; they say their prayers walking round them; the young
     dream upon their ashes, and the old steal away the fire to
     light up their domestic hearths with.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over our mythological accounts of this <i>winter god</i>, an almost
      impenetrable obscurity seems to hover; but if <i>Samhuin</i> is derived
      from <i>Samhfhuin</i>, as it is generally supposed, the term literally
      means the gathering or closing of summer; and, in fact, on the eve of the
      first of November we make our offerings round the domestic altar, (the
      fireside) of such fruits as the lingering season affords, besides playing
      a number of curious gambols, and performing many superstitious ceremonies,
      in which our young folk find great pleasure, and put great faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Glorvina, &ldquo;I love all those old ceremonies which force
      us to be periodically happy, and look forward with no little impatience to
      the gay-hearted pleasures which to-morrow will bring in its train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little post-boy has this moment tapped at my door for my letter, for
      he tells me he sets off before dawn, that he may be back in time for the
      sport. It is now past eleven o&rsquo;clock, but I could not resist giving you
      this little scrap of Irish mythology, before I wished you good night.

      LETTER XIX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ll the life-giving
      spirit of spring, mellowed by the genial glow of summer, shed its choicest
      treasures on the smiling hours which yesterday ushered in the most
      delightful of the seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arose earlier than usual; the exility of my mind would not suffer me to
      rest, and the scented air, as it breathed its odours through my open
      casement, seduced me abroad. I walked as though I scarcely touched the
      earth, and my spirit seemed to ascend like the lark which soared over my
      head to hail the splendour of the dewy dawn. There is a fairy vale in the
      little territories of Inismore, which is almost a miniature <i>Tempe</i>,
      and which is indeed the only spot on the peninsula where the luxuriant
      charms of the most bounteous nature are evidently improved by taste and
      cultivation. In a word, it is a spot sacred to the wanderings of Glorvina.
      It was there our theological discourse was held on the evening of my
      return, and thither my steps were now with an irresistible impulse
      directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had scarcely entered this Eden, when the form of the Eve, to whose
      picturesque fancy it owes so many charms presented itself. She was
      standing at a little distance <i>en profile</i>&mdash;with one hand she
      supported a part of her drapery filled with wild flowers, gathered ere the
      sun had kissed off the tears which night had shed upon their bosom; with
      the other she seemed carefully to remove some branches that entwined
      themselves through the sprays of a little hawthorn hedge richly embossed
      with the firstborn blossoms of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stole towards her, I exclaimed, as Adam did when he first saw Eve&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;&mdash;-Behold her,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Such as I saw her in my dream adorned,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With all that earth or heaven could bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and turned round, and in her surprise let fall her flowers,
      yet she smiled, and seemed confused&mdash;but pleasure, pure, animated,
      life-breathing pleasure, was the predominant expression of her
      countenance. The Deity of Health was never personified in more glowing
      colours&mdash;her eye&rsquo;s rich blue, her cheek&rsquo;s crimson blush, her lip&rsquo;s
      dewy freshness, the wanton wildness of her golden tresses, the delicious
      langour that mellowed the fire of her beamy glance&mdash;I gazed, and
      worshipped! but neither apologized for my intrusion, nor had the
      politeness to collect her scattered flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Nature,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;had always such a priestess to preside at her altar,
      who would worship at the shrine of Art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am her votarist only,&rdquo; she replied, smiling, and, pointing to a wild
      rose which had just begun to unfold its blushing breast amidst the snowy
      blossoms of the hedge&mdash;added, &ldquo;see how beautiful! how orient its hue
      appears through the pure crystal of the morning dew-drop! It is nearly
      three weeks since I first discovered it in the germ, since when I have
      screened it from the noonday ardours, and the evening&rsquo;s frost, and now it
      is just bursting into perfection to reward my cares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, she plucked it from the stem. Its crimson head drooped
      with the weight of the gems that spangled it. Glorvina did not shake them
      off, but imbibed the liquid fragrance with her lip; then held the flower
      to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to pledge you?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and I quaffed off the fairy nectar, which still trembled on
      the leaves her lip had consecrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;<i>both</i> drank from the same cup; and if the
      delicious draught which Nature has prepared for us, circulates with mutual
      effect through our veins&mdash;If&rdquo;&mdash;I paused, and cast down my eyes.
      The hand which still sustained the rose, and was still clasped in mine,
      seemed to tremble with an emotion scarcely inferior to that which thrilled
      through my whole frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute&rsquo;s pause&mdash;&ldquo;Take the rose,&rdquo; said Glorvina, endeavouring
      to extricate the precious hand which presented it&mdash;&ldquo;Take it; it is
      the first of the season! My father has had his snowdrop&mdash;the
      confessor his violet&mdash;and it is but just you should have your <i>rose</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the classical remark of the priest rushed, I believe, with
      mutual influence, to both our hearts. I, at least, was borne away by the
      rapturous feelings of the moment, and knelt to receive the offering of my
      lovely votarist.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kissed the sweet and simple tribute with pious ardour; but with a
      devotion more fervid, kissed the hand that presented it. I would not have
      exchanged that moment for the most pleasurable era of my existence. The
      blushing radiance that glowed on her cheek, sent its warm suffusion even
      to the hand I had violated with my unhallowed lip; while the sparkling
      fluid of her eyes, turned on mine in almost dying softness, beamed on the
      latent powers of my once-chilled heart, and awakened there a thousand
      delicious transports, a thousand infant wishes and chaste desires, of
      which I lately thought its worn-out feelings were no longer susceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I arose, I plucked off a small branch of that myrtle which here grows
      wild, and which, like my rose, was dripping in dew, and putting it into
      the hand I still held, said, &ldquo;This offering is indeed less beautiful, less
      fragrant, than that which you have made; but remember, it is also less <i>fragile</i>&mdash;for
      the sentiment of which it is an emblem, carries with it an eternity of
      duration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina took it in silence and placed it in her bosom; and in silence we
      walked together towards the castle; while our eyes, now timidly turned on
      each other, now suddenly averted (O, the insidious danger of the abruptly
      downcast eye!) met no object but what breathed of love, whose soul seemed
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;&mdash;Sent abroad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Warm through the vital air, and on the heart
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Harmonious seiz&rsquo;d.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning breeze flushed with etherial fervour; the luxury of the
      landscape through which we wandered, the sublimity of those stupendous
      cliffs which seemed to shelter two hearts from the world, to which their
      profound feelings were unknown, while
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &mdash;Every copse
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Deep tangled, but irregular, and bush,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Bending with dewy moisture o&rsquo;er the head,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of the coy choiristers that lodged within,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Were prodigal of harmony,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and crowned imagination&rsquo;s wildest wish, and realized the fancy&rsquo;s warmest
      vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my sweet friend!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;since now I feel myself entitled thus
      to call you&mdash;well indeed might your nation have held this day sacred;
      and while the heart, which now throbs with an emotion to which it has
      hitherto been a stranger, beats with the pulse of life, on the return of
      this day will it make its offering to that glorious orb, to whose genial
      nutritive beams this precious rose owes its existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I spoke, Father John suddenly appeared. Vexed as I was at this
      unseasonable intrusion, yet in such perfect harmony was my spirit with the
      whole creation, that, in the true hyperbola of Irish cordiality, I wished
      him a thousand happy returns of this season!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken like a true-born Irishman!&rdquo; said the priest, laughing, and shaking
      me heartily by the hand&mdash;&ldquo;While with something of the phlegm of an
      Englishman, I wish you only as many returns of it as shall bring health
      and felicity in their train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then looking at the myrtle which reposed on the bosom of Glorvina, and the
      rose which I so proudly wore, he added&mdash;&ldquo;So, I perceive you have both
      been sacrificing to <i>Beal</i>; and like the priests and priestesses of
      this country in former times, are adorned with the flowers of the season.
      For you must know, Mr. Mortimer, <i>we</i> had our Druidesses as well as
      our Druids; and both, like the ministers of Grecian mythology, were
      crowned with flowers at the time of sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this apposite remark of the good priest, I stole a glance at <i>my</i>
      lovely priestess. Hero, at the altar of the deity she rivalled, never
      looked more attractive to the enamoured Leander.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now come within a few steps of the portals of the castle, and I
      observed that since I passed that way, the path and entrance were strewed
      with green flags, rushes, and wild crocuses; * while the heavy framework
      of the door was hung with garlands, and bunches of flowers, tastefully
      displayed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Seeing the doors of the Greeks on the first of May,
     profusely ornamented with flowers, would certainly recall to
     your mind the many descriptions of that custom which you
     have met with in the Greek and Latin poets.&mdash;Letters on
     Greece, by Moniseur Da Guys, vol i. p. 153.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, madam,&rdquo; said I to Glorvina, &ldquo;is doubtless the result of your happy
      taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;&ldquo;this is a custom prevalent among the
      peasantry time immemorial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And most probably was brought hither,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;from Greece by
      our Phonician progenitors: for we learn from Athenæus, that the young
      Greeks hung garlands on the doors of their favourite mistresses on the
      first of May. Nor indeed does the Roman <i>floralia</i> differ in any
      respect from ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those, however, which you now admire,&rdquo; said Glorvina, smiling, &ldquo;are no
      offerings of rustic gallantry; for every hut in the country, on this
      morning, will bear the same fanciful decorations. The wild crocus, and
      indeed every flower of that rich tint, is peculiarly sacred to this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, when, in the course of the day, I rambled out alone, and
      looked into the several cabins, I perceived not only their floors covered
      with flags and rushes, but a &ldquo;Maybush,&rdquo; as they call it, or small tree,
      planted before all the doors, covered with every flower the season
      affords.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw nothing of Glorvina until evening, except for a moment, when I
      perceived her lost over a book, (as I passed her closet window) which, by
      the Morocco binding, I knew to be the Letters of the impassioned Heloise.
      Since her society was denied me, I was best satisfied to resign her to
      Rosseau. <i>Apropos!</i> it was among the books I brought hither; and they
      were all precisely such books as Glorvina had <i>not</i> yet <i>should</i>
      read, that she may know herself, and the latent sensibility of her soul.
      They have, of course, all been presented to her, and consist of &ldquo;<i>La
      Nouvelle Hel oise</i>&rdquo; de Rosseau&mdash;the unrivalled &ldquo;<i>Lettres sur la
      Mythologie</i>&rdquo; de Moustier&mdash;the &ldquo;<i>Paul et Virginie</i>&rdquo; of St.
      Pierre&mdash;the <i>Werter</i> of Goethe&mdash;the <i>Dolhreuse</i> of
      Lousel, and the <i>Attilla</i> of Chateaubriand. Let our English novels
      carry away the prize of morality from the romantic fictions of every other
      country; but you will find they rarely seize on the imagination through
      the medium of the heart; and as for their heroines, I confess, that though
      they are the most perfect beings, they are also the most stupid. Surely,
      virtue would not be the less attractive for being united to genius and the
      graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to the never-to-be-forgotten <i>first of May!</i> Early in
      the evening the Prince, his daughter, the priest, the bard, the old nurse,
      and indeed all the household of Inismore, adjourned to the vale, which
      being the only level ground on the peninsula, is always appropriated to
      the sports of the rustic neighbours. It was impossible I should enter this
      vale without emotion; and when I beheld it crowded with the vulgar throng,
      I felt as if it were profanation for the
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Sole of unblest feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      to tread that ground sacred to the most refined emotions of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina, who walked on before the priest and me, supporting her father,
      as we entered the vale stole a glance at me; and a moment after, as I
      opened the little wicket through which we passed, I murmured in her ear&mdash;<i>La
      val di Rosa!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      We found this charming spot crowded with peasantry of both sexes and all
      ages. * Since morning they had planted a Maybush in the centre, which was
      hung with flowers, and round the seats appropriated to the Prince and his
      family, the flag, crocus, and primrose, were profusely scattered. Two
      blind fiddlers, and an excellent piper, ** were seated under the shelter
      of the very hedge which had been the nursery of my precious rose; while
      the old bard, with true druidical dignity sat under the shade of a
      venerable oak, near his master.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the summer of 1802, the author was present at a rural
     festival at the seat of a highly respected friend in
     Tipperary, from which this scene is partly copied.

     ** Although the bagpipe is not an instrument indigenous to
     Ireland, it holds a high antiquity in the country. It was
     the music of the Kearns, in the reign of Edward the Third.
     [See Smith&rsquo;s History of Cork, page 43.] It is still the
     favourite accompaniment of those mirthful exertions with
     which laborious poverty crowns the temporary cessation of
     its weekly toil, and the cares and solicitudes of the Irish
     peasant ever dissipate to the spell which breathes in the
     humorous drones of the Irish pipes. To Scotland we are
     indebted for this ancient instrument, who received it from
     the Romans; but to the native musical genius of Ireland are
     we indebted for its present form and improved state. &lsquo;That
     at present in use in Ireland,&rsquo; says Dr. Burney, in a letter
     to J. C. Walker, Esq., is an improved bagpipe, on which I
     have heard some of the natives play very well in two parts,
     without the drone, which, I believe, is never attempted in
     Scotland The tone of the lower notes resembles that of an
     hautboy or clarionet, and the high notes, that of a German
     flute: and the whole scale of one I heard lately was very
     well in tune, which has never been the case of any Scottish
     bagpipe that I have yet heard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The sports began with a wrestling match; * and in the gymnastic exertions
      of the youthful combatants there was something, I thought, of Spartan
      energy and hardihood.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The young Irish peasantry particularly prize themselves on
     this species of exertion: they have almost reduced it to a
     science, by dividing it into two distinct species&mdash;the one
     called &ldquo;sparnaight,&rdquo; engages the arms only; the other,
     &ldquo;carriaght,&rdquo; engages the whole body.
</pre>
    <p>
      But as &ldquo;breaking of ribs is no sport for ladies,&rdquo; Glorvina turned from the
      spectacle in disgust; which I wished might have been prolonged, as it
      procured me (who leaned over her seat) her undivided attention; but it was
      too soon concluded, though without any disagreeable consequences, for
      neither of the combatants were hurt, though one was laid prostrate. The
      victorious wrestler was elected King of the May; and, with &ldquo;all his
      blushing honours thick upon him,&rdquo; came timidly forward, and laid his rural
      crown at the feet of Glorvina. Yet he evidently seemed intoxicated with
      his happiness, and though he scarcely touched the hand of his blushing,
      charming nueen, yet I perceived a thousand saucy triumphs basking in his
      fine black eyes, as he led her out to dance. The fellow was handsome too.
      I know not why, but I could have knocked him down with all my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every village has its Cæsar,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;and this is ours. He has
      been elected King of the May for these five years successively He is
      second son to our old steward, and a very worthy, as well as a very fine
      young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt his worth,&rdquo; returned I, peevish ly, &ldquo;but it certainly
      cannot exceed the condescension of his young mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing singular in it, however,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Among us,
      over such meetings as these, inequality of rank holds no <i>obvious</i>
      jurisdiction, though in fact it is not the less regarded; and the
      condescension of the master or mistress on these occasions, lessens
      nothing of the respect of the servant upon every other; but rather secures
      it, through the medium of gratitude and affection.&rdquo; The piper had now
      struck up one of those lilts, whose mirth-inspiring influence it is almost
      impossible to resist.* The Irish jig, above every other dance, leaves most
      to the genius of the dancer; and Glorvina, above all the women I have ever
      seen, seems most formed by nature to exce in the art. Her little form,
      pliant as that of an Egyptian <i>alma</i>, floats before the eye in all
      the swimming langour of the most graceful motion, or all the gay exility
      of soul-inspired animation. She even displays an exquisite degree of comic
      humour in some of the movements of her national dance: and her eyes,
      countenance, and air express the wildest exhilaration of pleasure, and
      glow with all the spirit of health, mirth, and exercise.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Besides the Irish jig, tradition has rescued from that
     oblivion which time has hung over the ancient Irish dance,
     the <i>rinceadh fada</i>, which answers to the festal dance of
     the Greeks; and the <i>rinceadh</i>, or war dance, &ldquo;which seems,&rdquo;
      says Mr. Walker, &ldquo;to have been of the nature of the armed
     dance, which is so ancient, and with which the Grecian youth
     amused themselves during the seige of Troy.&rdquo; Previous to the
     adoption of the French style in dancing, Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran
     asserts, that both our private and public balls always
     concluded with the &ldquo;rinceadh-fada.&rdquo; On the arrival of James
     the Second at Kinsale, his adherents received the
     unfortunate prince on the shore with this dance, with whose
     taste and execution he was infinitely delighted: and even
     still, in the county of Limerick and many other parts of
     Ireland, the &ldquo;rinceadh-fada&rdquo; is danced on the eve of May.
</pre>
    <p>
      I was so struck with the grace and elegance of her movements, the delicacy
      of her form, and the play of her drapery gently agitated by the air, that
      I involuntarily gave to my admiration an audible existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the priest, who overheard me, &ldquo;she performs her national dance
      with great grace and spirit. But the Irish are all dancers; and, like the
      Greeks, we have no idea of any festival here which does not conclude with
      a dance; * old and young, rich and poor, all join here in the sprightly
      dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;The passion of the Greeks for dancing is common to both
     sexes, who neglect every other consideration when they have
     an opportunity of indulging that passion.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Glorvina, unwearied, still continued to dance with unabated spirit, and
      even seemed governed by the general principle which actuates all the Irish
      dancers&mdash;of not giving way to any competitor in the exertion; for she
      actually outdanced her partner, who had been jigging with all his <i>strength</i>,
      while she had only been dancing with all her <i>soul</i>; and when he
      retreated, she dropped a simple curtsey (according to the laws of
      jig-dancing here) to another young rustic, whose seven league brogues
      finally prevailed, and Glorvina at last gave way, while he made a scrape
      to a rosy cheeked, barefooted damsel, who out jigged him and his two
      successors; and thus the chain went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina, as she came panting and glowing towards me, exclaimed, &ldquo;I have
      done my duty for the evening;&rdquo; and threw herself on a seat, breathless and
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;more than your duty; for you even performed a work of
      supererogation.&rdquo; And I cast a pointed look at the young rustic who had
      been the object of her election.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O!&rdquo; she replied, eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;it is the custom here, and I should be
      sorry, for the indulgence of an overstrained delicacy, to violate any of
      those established rules to which, however trifling, they are devotedly
      attached. Besides, you perceive,&rdquo; she added, smiling, &ldquo;this condescension
      on the part of the females, who are thus &lsquo;won unsought,&rsquo; does not render
      the men more presumptuous. You see what a distance the youth of both sexes
      preserve&mdash;a distance which always exists in these kind of public
      meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, the lads and lasses were ranged opposite to each other, with
      no other intercourse than what the communion of the eyes afforded, or the
      transient intimacy of the jig bestowed. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This custom, so prevalent in some parts of Ireland, is of
     a very ancient origin. We read in Keating&rsquo;s History of
     Ireland, that in the remotest periods, when the Irish
     brought their children to the fair of Tailtean, in order to
     dispose of them in marriage, the strictest order was
     observed; the men and women having distinct places assigned
     them at a certain distance from each other.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you not dance a jig?&rdquo; asked Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom dance,&rdquo; said I&mdash;&ldquo;Ill health has for some time back
      coincided with my inclination, which seldom led me to try my skill at the
      <i>Poetry of motion?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poetry of motion!&rdquo; repeated Glorvina&mdash;&ldquo;What a beautiful idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and if it had been my own, it must have owed its
      existence to you; for your dancing is certainly the true poetry of motion,
      and <i>Epic</i> poetry too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love dancing with all my heart,&rdquo; she replied: &ldquo;when I dance I have not
      a care on earth&mdash;every thing swims gaily before me; and I feel as
      swiftly borne away in a vortex of pleasurable sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dancing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is the talent of your sex&mdash;that pure grace which
      must result from a symmetrical form, and that elixity of temperament which
      is the effect of woman&rsquo;s delicate organization, creates you dancers. And
      while I beheld your performances this evening, I no longer wondered that
      the gravity of Socrates could not resist the spell which lurked in the
      graceful motions of Aspasia, but followed her in the mazes of the dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed, and said, I &ldquo;flattered too agreeably, not to be listened to
      with <i>pleasure</i>, if not with <i>faith</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In short, I have had a thousand occasions to observe, that while she
      receives a decided compliment with the ease of almost <i>bon ton
      nonchalance</i>, a look, a broken sentence, a word, has the power of
      overwhelming her with confusion, or awakening all the soul of emotion in
      her bosom. All this I can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dew of the evening now began to fall, the invalid Prince and his
      lovely daughter arose to retire. And those who had been rendered so happy
      by their condescension, beheld their retreat with regret, and followed
      them with blessings. Whiskey, milk, and oaten bread were now distributed
      in abundance by the old nurse and the steward; and the dancing was
      recommenced with new ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest and I remained behind, conversing with the old and jesting with
      the young&mdash;he in Irish, and I in English, with such as understood it.
      The girls received my little gallantries with considerable archness, and
      even with some point of repartee; while the priest rallied them in their
      own way, for he seems as playful as a child among them, though evidently
      worshipped as a sakit. And the moon rose resplendently over the vale,
      before it was restored to its wonted solitary silence.

    <p>
      Glorvina has made the plea of a headache these two mornings back, for
      playing the truant at her drawing desk; but the fact is, her days and
      nights are devoted to the sentimental sorcery of Rosseau, and the effects
      of her studies are visible in her eyes. When we meet, her glance sinks
      beneath the ardour of mine in soft confusion; her manner is no longer
      childishly playful, or carelessly indifferent, and sometimes a sigh,
      scarce breathed, is discovered by the blush which glows on her cheek for
      the inadvertency of her lip. Does she, then, begin to feel she has a
      heart? Does &ldquo;<i>Le besoin de l&rsquo;ame tendre</i>,&rdquo; already throb with vague
      emotion in her bosom? Her abstracted air, her delicious melancholy, her
      unusual softness, betray the nature of the feelings by which she is
      overwhelmed&mdash;they are new to herself; and sometimes I fancy, when she
      turns her melting eyes on me, it is to solicit their meaning. O! if I
      dared become the interpreter between her and her heart&mdash;if I dared
      indulge myself in the hope, the belief that&mdash;&mdash; and what then?
      &rsquo;Tis all folly, &rsquo;tis madness, &rsquo;tis worse! But whoever
      yet rejected the blessing for which his soul thirsted?&mdash;And in the
      scale of human felicities, if there is one in which all others is summed
      up&mdash;above all others supremely elevated&mdash;it is the consciousness
      of having awakened the first sentiment of the sweetest, the sublimest of
      all passions, in the bosom of youth, genius, and sensibility.

    <h3>
      LETTER XX.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> had just finished
      my last by the beams of a gloriously setting sun, when I was startled by a
      pebble being thrown in at my window. I looked out, and perceived Father
      John in the act of flinging up another, which the hand of Glorvina (who
      was leaning on his arm) prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not engaged in writing to your mistress,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come down
      and join us in a ramble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And though I were,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I could not resist your challenge.&rdquo; And
      down I flew&mdash;Glorvina laughing, sent me back for my hat, and we
      proceeded on our walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an evening,&rdquo; said I, looking at Glorvina, &ldquo;worthy of the morning
      of the first of May, and we have seized it in that happy moment so
      exquisitly described by Collins:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;While now the bright hair&rsquo;d sun
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sits on yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With brede etherial wove,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O&rsquo;erhang his wavy bed.&rsquo;&rdquo;=>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! that beautiful ode!&rdquo; exclaimed Glorvina, with all her wildest
      enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;never can I read&mdash;never hear it repeated but with
      emotion. The perusal of Ossian&rsquo;s &lsquo;Song of Other Times,&rsquo; the breezy
      respiration of my harp at twilight, the last pale rose that outlives its
      season, and bears on its faded breast the frozen tears of the wintry dawn,
      and Collins&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ode to Evening,&rsquo; awaken in my heart and fancy the same
      train of indescribable feeling, of exquisite, yet unspeakable sensation.
      Alas! the solitary pleasure of feeling thus alone the utter impossibility
      of conveying to the bosom of another those ecstatic emotions by which our
      own is sublimed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While my very soul followed this brilliant comet to her perihelion of
      sentiment and imagination, I fixed my eyes on her &ldquo;mind-illumin&rsquo;d face,&rdquo;
       and said, &ldquo;And is expression then necessary for the conveyance of such
      profound, such exquisite feeling? May not the similarity of a refined
      organization exist between souls, and produce that mutual intelligence
      which sets the necessity of cold, verbal expression at defiance? May not
      the sympathy of a kindred sensibility in the bosom of another, meet and
      enjoy those delicious feelings by which yours is warmed, and, sinking
      beneath the inadequacy of language to give them birth, feel like you, in
      silent and sacred emotion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the priest, with his usual simplicity, &ldquo;this sacred
      sympathy, between two refined and elevated souls, in the sublime and
      beautiful of the moral and natural world, approaches nearest to the
      rapturous and pure emotions which uncreated spirits may be supposed to
      feel in their heavenly communion, than any other human sentiment with
      which we are acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all the looks of blandishment which ever flung their spell from
      beauty&rsquo;s eye, I would not have exchanged the glance which Glorvina at that
      moment cast on me. While the priest, who seemed to have been following up
      the train of thought awakened by our preceding observations, abruptly
      added, after a silence of some minutes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a species of metaphorical taste, if I may be allowed the
      expression, whose admiration for certain objects is not deducible from the
      established rules of beauty, order, or even truth; which <i>should</i> be
      the basis of our approbation; yet which ever brings with it a sensation of
      more lively pleasure; as for instance, a chromatic passion in music will
      awaken a thrill of delight which a simple chord could never effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would the most self-evident truth,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;awaken so vivid a
      sensation, as when we find some sentiment of the soul illustrated by some
      law or principle in science. To an axiom we announce our assent, but we
      lavish our most enthusiastic approbation when Rosseau tells us that &lsquo;Les
      ames humaines veulent etre accomplies pour valoir toute leurs prix, et la
      force unie des ames <i>comme celles des l&rsquo;armes d&rsquo;un aimant artificiel</i>,
      est incomparablement plus grands que la somme de leurs force
      particulier.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this quotation was meant <i>all</i> for Glorvina, I looked earnestly at
      her as I repeated it. A crimson torrent rushed to her cheek, and convinced
      me that she felt the full force of a sentiment so applicable to us both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; said I, addressing her in a low voice, &ldquo;was Rosseau excluded
      from the sacred coalition with Ossian, Collins, your twilight harp, and
      winter rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina made no reply; but turned full on me her &ldquo;eyes of dewy light.&rdquo;
       Mine almost sunk beneath the melting ardour of their soul-beaming o o
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! child of Nature! child of genius and of passion! why was I withheld
      from throwing myself at thy feet; from offering thee the homage of that
      soul thou hast awakened; from covering thy hands with my kisses, and
      bathing them with tears of such delicious emotion, as thou only hast power
      to inspire?
    </p>
    <p>
      While we thus &ldquo;<i>buvames a longs traits le philtre de l&rsquo;amour,</i>&rdquo;
       Father John gradually restored us to commonplace existence, by a
      commonplace conversation on the fineness of the weather, promising aspect
      of the season, &amp;c., until the moon, as it rose sublimely above the
      summit of the mountain, called forth the melting tones of my Glorvina&rsquo;s
      syren voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting up her eyes to that Heaven whence they seem to have caught their
      emanation, she said, &ldquo;I do not wonder that unenlightened nations should
      worship the moon. Our ideas are so intimately connected with our senses,
      so ductilely transferable from cause to effect, that the abstract thought
      may readily subside in the sensible image which awakens it. When, in the
      awful stillness of a calm night, I fix my eyes on the mild and beautiful
      orb, the <i>created</i> has become the awakening medium of that adoration
      I offered to the <i>Creator</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I remember that even in your childhood, you used
      to fix your eyes on the moon, and gaze and wonder. I believe it would have
      been no difficult matter to have plunged you back into the heathenism of
      your ancestors, and to have made it one of the gods of your idolatry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was the chaste Luna in the <i>album sanctorum</i> of your Druidical
      mythology?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;we read in the life of our celebrated
      saint, St. Columba, that on the altar-piece of a Druidical temple, the
      sun, moon, and stars were curiously depicted; and the form of the ancient
      Irish oath of allegiance, was to swear by the sun, moon, and stars, and
      other deities, celestial as well as terrestrial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did your mythology touch so closely on that of the Greeks?
      Had you also your Pans and your Daphnes, as well as your Dians and
      Apollos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a curious anecdote that evinces it,&rdquo; returned the priest&mdash;&ldquo;It
      is many years since I read it in a black-letter memoir of St. Patrick. The
      Saint, says the biographer, attended by three bishops, and some less
      dignified of his brethren, being in this very province, arose early one
      morning, and with his pious associates, placed himself near a fountain or
      well, and began to chant a hymn. In the neighbourhood of this honoured
      fountain stood the palace of <i>Cruachan</i>, where the two daughters of
      the Emperor Laogare were educating in retirement; and as the saints sung
      by no means <i>sotto voce</i>, * their pious strains caught the attention
      of the royal fair ones, who were enjoying an early ramble, and who
      immediately sought the sanctified choristers. Full of that curiosity so
      natural to the youthful recluses, they were by no means sparing of
      interrogations to the Saint, and among other questions demanded, &lsquo;and who
      is your God? Where dwells he, in heaven or on the earth, or beneath the
      earth, or in the mountain, or in the valley, or the sea, or the stream?&rsquo;&mdash;And
      indeed, even to this day, we have Irish for a river god, which we call <i>Divona</i>.&mdash;You
      perceive, therefore, that our ancient religion was by no means an
      unpoetical one.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A musical voice was an indispensable quality in an Irish
     Saint, and &ldquo;lungs of leather&rdquo; no trivial requisite towards
     obtaining canonization. St. Columbkill, we are told, sung so
     loud, that, according to an old Irish poem, called &ldquo;Amhra
     Chioluim chille,&rdquo; or The Vision of Columbkill, &ldquo;His hallow&rsquo;d
     voice beyond a mile was heard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      While we spoke, we observed a figure emerging from a coppice towards a
      small well, which issued beneath the roots of a blasted oak. The priest
      motioned us to stop, and be silent&mdash;the figure (which was that of an
      ancient female wrapped in a long cloak,) approached, and having drank of
      the well out of a little cup, she went three times round it on her knees,
      praying with great fervency over her beads; then rising after this painful
      ceremony, she tore a small part of her under garb, and hung it on the
      branch of the tree which shaded the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ceremony, I perceive,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;surprises you; but you have
      now witnessed the remains of one of our ancient superstitions. The ancient
      Irish, like the Greeks, were religiously attached to the consecrated
      fountain, the <i>Vel expiatoria</i>; and our early missionaries,
      discovering the fondness of the natives for these sanctified springs,
      artfully diverted the course of their superstitious faith, and dedicated
      them to Christian saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is really,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;something truly classic in this spot; and here
      is this little shrine of Christian superstition hung with the same votive
      gifts as Pausanius informs us obscured the statue of Hygeia in Secyonia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is nothing extraordinary here,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;these consecrated
      wells are to be found in every part of the kingdom. But of all our <i>Acquo
      Sanctificato</i>, Lough Derg is the most celebrated. It is the <i>Loretto</i>
      of Ireland, and votarists from every part of the kingdom resort to it. So
      great, indeed, is the still-existing veneration among the lower orders for
      these holy wells, that those who live at too great a distance to make a
      pilgrimage to one, are content to purchase a species of amulet made of a
      sliver of the tree which shades the well, (and imbued with its waters,)
      which they wear round their necks. These curious amulets are sold at
      fairs, by a species of sturdy beggar, called a <i>Bacagh</i>, who stands
      with a long pole, with a box fixed at the top of it, for the reception of
      alms; while he alternately extols the miraculous property of the amulet,
      and details his own miseries; thus at once endeavouring to interest the
      faith and charity of the always benevolent, always credulous multitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that religion in all ages and in all countries should
      depend so much on the impositions of one half of mankind, and the
      credulity and indolence of the other. Thus the Egyptians (to whom even
      Greece herself stood indebted for the principles of those arts and
      sciences by which she became the most illustrious country in the world)
      resigned themselves so entirely to the impositions of their priests, as to
      believe that the safety and happiness of life itself depended on the
      motions of an ox, or the tameness of a crocodile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop,&rdquo; interrupted Father John, smiling; &ldquo;you forget, that though
      you wear the <i>San-Benito</i>, or robe of heresy yourself, you are in the
      company of those who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly think on <i>certain points</i>,&rdquo; interrupted I, &ldquo;even as my
      heretical self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This observation led to a little controversial dialogue, which, as it
      would stand a very poor chance of being read by you, will stand none at
      all of being transcribed by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we returned home we found the Prince impatiently watching for us at
      the window, fearful lest the dews of heaven should have fallen too heavily
      on the head of his heart&rsquo;s idol, who finished her walk in silence; either,
      I believe, not much pleased with the turn given to the conversation by the
      priest, or not sufficiently interested in it.

      I know not how it is, but since the morning of the first of May, I feel as
      though my soul had entered into a covenant with hers; as though our very
      beings were indissolubly interwoven with each other. And yet the freedom
      which once existed in our intercourse is fled. I approach her trembling;
      and she repels the most distant advances with such dignified softness,
      such chastely modest reserve, that the restraint I sometimes labour under
      in her presence, is almost concomitant to the bliss it bestows.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, when she came to her drawing-desk, she held a volume of <i>De
      Moustier</i> in her hand&mdash;&ldquo;I have brought this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for ou <i>bon
      Pere Directeur</i> to read out to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has commissioned me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to make his excuses; he is gone to
      visit a sick man on the other side of the mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this intelligence she blushed to the eyes; but suddenly recovering
      herself, she put the book into my hands, and said with a smile, &ldquo;then you
      must officiate for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was seated at the drawing-desk, I opened the book, and by
      chance at the beautiful description of the <i>Boudoir</i>:

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you could see this creature, when anything is said or read that
      comes home to her heart, or strikes in immediate unison with the exquisite
      tone of her feelings. Never sure was there a finer commentary than her
      looks and gestures passed on any work of interest which engages her
      attention. Before I had finished the perusal of this charming little
      fragment, the pencil had dropped from her fingers; and often she waved her
      beautiful head and smiled, and breathed a faint exclamation of delight;
      and when I laid down the book, she said, while she leaned her face on her
      clasped hands&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too have a boudoir!&mdash;but even a <i>bou-doir</i> may become a
      dreary solitude, except&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;she paused; and I added, from the
      poem I had just read, &ldquo;except that within its social little limits
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;La confidence ingénu rapproche deux amis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, half raised to mine, suddenly cast down, beamed a tender
      acquiescence to the sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if the being worthy of sharing the bliss such an
      intercourse in such a place must confer, is yet to be found, is its
      hallowed circle inviolable to the intrusive footstep of an inferior,
      though perhaps not less ardent votarist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have been here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have scarcely ever visited this
      once favourite retreat myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to take that as a compliment or otherwise?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as it is meant,&rdquo; said she&mdash;&ldquo;as a fact;&rdquo; and she added, with an
      inadvertent simplicity, into which the ardour of her temper often betrays
      her&mdash;&ldquo;I never can devote myself partially to anything&mdash;I am
      either all enthusiasm or all indifference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not for the world would I have made her <i>feel</i> the full force of this
      avowal; but requested permission to visit this now deserted boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;&ldquo;it is a little closet in that ruined
      tower, which terminates the corridor in which your apartment lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I am privileged?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; she returned; and the Prince who had risen unusually early,
      entered the room at that moment, and joined us at the drawing-desk.

    <p>
      The absence of the good priest left me to a solitary dinner. Glorvina (as
      is usual with her) spent the first part of the evening in her father&rsquo;s
      room; and thus denied her society, I endeavoured to supply its want&mdash;its
      soul-felt want, by a visit to her boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain tone of feeling when fancy is in its acme, when
      sentiment holds the senses in subordination, and the visionary joys which
      float in the imagination shed a livelier bliss on the soul, than the best
      pleasures cold reality ever conferred. Then, even the presence of a
      beloved object is not more precious to the heart than the spot consecrated
      to her memory; where we fancy the very air is impregnated with her
      respiration; every object is hallowed by her recent touch, and that all
      around breathes of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a mood of mind, I ascended to Glor-vina&rsquo;s boudoir; and I really
      believe, that had she accompanied, I should have felt less than when alone
      and unseen I stole to the asylum of her pensive thoughts. It lay as she
      had described; and almost as I passed its threshold, I was sensibly struck
      by the incongruity of its appearance&mdash;it seemed to me as though it
      had been partly furnished in the beginning of one century, and finished in
      the conclusion of another. The walls were rudely wainscotted with oak,
      black with age; yet the floor was covered with a Turkey carpet, rich, new,
      and beautiful&mdash;better adapted to cover a Parisian dressing-room than
      the closet of a ruined tower. The casements were high and narrow, but
      partly veiled with a rich drapery of scarlet silk: a few old chairs, heavy
      and cumbrous, were interspersed with stools of an antique form; one of
      which lay folded upon the ground, so as to be portable in a travelling
      trunk. On a ponderous Gothic table (which seemed a fixture coeval with the
      building) was placed a silver <i>escritoire</i>, of curious and elegant
      workmanship, and two small, but beautiful antique vases (filled with
      flowers) of Etrurian elegance. Two little book-shelves, elegantly
      designed, but most clumsily executed, (probably by some hedge-carpenter)
      were filled with the best French, English, and Italian poets; and, to my
      utter astonishment, not only some new publications scarce six months old,
      but two London newspapers of no distant date, lay scattered on the table,
      with some MS. music, and some unfinished drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gratified my curiosity, by examining the singular incongruities of
      this paradoxical boudoir, I leaned for some time against one of the
      windows, endeavouring to make out some defaced lines cut on its panes with
      a diamond, when Glorvina herself entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stood concealed by the silken drapery, she did not perceive me. A
      basket of flowers hung on her arm, from which she replenished the vases,
      having first flung away their faded treasures. As she stood thus engaged
      and cheering her sweet employment with a murmured song, I stole softly
      behind her, and my breath disturbing the ringlets which had escaped from
      the bondage of her bodkin, and seemed to cling to her neck for protection,
      she turned quickly round, and with a start, a blush, and a smile, said,
      &ldquo;Ah! <i>so soon</i> here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You perceive,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your immunity was not lost on me! I have been
      here this half hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; she replied, and casting round a quick inquiring glance, hastily
      collected the scattered papers, and threw them into a drawer; adding, &ldquo;I
      intended to have made some arrangements in this deserted little place,
      that you might see it in its best garb; but had scarcely begun the
      necessary reform this morning, when I was suddenly called to my father,
      and could not till this moment find leisure to return hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke I gazed earnestly at her. It struck me there was a
      something of mystery over this apartment, yet wherefore should mystery
      dwell where all breathes the ingenuous simplicity of the golden age?
      Glorvina moved towards the casement, threw open the sash, and laid her
      fresh gathered flowers on the seat. Their perfume scented the room; and a
      new fallen shower still glittered on the honeysuckle which she was
      endeavouring to entice through the window round which it crept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting with rather a mild than a dazzling splendour, and the
      landscape was richly impurpled with its departing beams, which, as they
      darted through the scarlet drapery of the curtain, shed warmly over the
      countenance and figure of Glorvina &ldquo;<i>Love&rsquo;s proper hue</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both remained silent, until her eye accidentally meeting mine, a more
      &ldquo;celestial rosy red&rdquo; invested her cheek. She seated herself in the window,
      and I drew a chair and sat near her. All within was the softest gloom&mdash;all
      without the most solemn stillness. The gray vapours of twilight were
      already stealing amidst the illumined clouds that floated in the
      atmosphere&mdash;the sun&rsquo;s golden beams no longer scattered round their
      rich suffusion; and the glow of retreating day was fading even from the
      horizon where its parting glories faintly lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sweet hour,&rdquo; said Glorvina, softly sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a <i>boudoirizing</i> hour,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a golden one for a poetic heart,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or an enamoured one,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;It is the hour in which the soul best
      knows itself; when every low-thoughted care is excluded, and the pensive
      pleasures take possession of the dis solving heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Ces douces lumières
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Ces sombre certes
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Sont les jours de la volupté.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the <i>voluptas</i> of Epicurus, but those refined and
      elegant enjoyments which must derive their spirit from virtue and from
      health; from a vivid fancy, susceptible feelings, and a cultivated mind;
      and which are never so fully tasted as in this sweet season of the day;
      then the influence of sentiment is buoyant over passion; the soul, alive
      to the sublimest impression, expands in the region of pure and elevated
      meditation: the passions, slumbering in the soft repose of Nature, leave
      the heart free to the reception of the purest, warmest, tenderest
      sentiments&mdash;when all is delicious melancholy, or pensive softness;
      when every vulgar wish is hushed, and a rapture, an indefinable rapture,
      thrills with sweet vibration on every nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thus I have felt,&rdquo; said the all-impassioned Glorvina, clasping her
      hands and fixing her humid eyes on mine&mdash;&ldquo;thus, in the dearth of all
      <i>kindred</i> feeling, have I felt. But never, oh! till <i>now&mdash;never!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and
      she abruptly paused, and drooped her head on the back of my chair, over
      which my hand rested, and felt the soft pressure of her glowing cheek,
      while her balmy sigh breathed its odour on my lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh had not her celestial confidence, her angelic purity, sublimed every
      thought, restrained every wish; at that moment; that too fortunate; too
      dangerous moment!!!&mdash;Yet even as it was, in the delicious agony of my
      soul, I secretly exclaimed with the legislator of Lesbos&mdash;&ldquo;<i>It is
      too difficult to be always virtuous!</i>&rdquo; while I half audibly breathed on
      the ear of Glorvina&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, O first of all created beings! never, never till I beheld thee,
      did I know the pure rapture which the intercourse of a kindred soul
      awakens&mdash;of that sacred communion with a superior intelligence,
      which, while it raises me in my own estimation, tempts me to emulate that
      excellence I adore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina raised her head&mdash;her melting eyes met mine, and her cheek
      rivalled the snow of that hand which was pressed with passionate ardour on
      my lips. Then her eyes were bashfully withdrawn; she again drooped her
      head&mdash;not on the chair, but on my shoulder. What followed, angels
      might have attested&mdash;but the eloquence of bliss is silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffice it to say, that I am now certain of at least being understood; and
      that in awakening her comprehension, I have roused my own. In a word, I <i>now</i>
      feel I love!!&mdash;for the first time I feel it. For the first time my
      heart is alive to the most profound, the most delicate, the most ardent,
      and most refined of all human passions. I am now conscious that I have
      hitherto mistaken the senses for the heart, and the blandishments of a
      vitiated imagination for the pleasures of the soul. In short, I now feel
      myself in that state of beatitude, when the fruition of all the heart&rsquo;s
      purest wishes leaves me nothing to desire, and the innocence of those
      wishes nothing to fear. You know but little of the sentiment which now
      pervades my whole being, and blends with every atom of my frame, if you
      suppose I have formally told Glorvina I loved her, or that I appear even
      to suspect that I am (rapturous thought!) beloved in return. On the
      contrary, the same mysterious delicacy, the same delicious reserve still
      exist. It is a sigh, a glance, a broken sentence, an imperceptible motion,
      (imperceptible to all eyes but our own) that betrays us to each other.
      Once I used to fall at the feet of the &ldquo;<i>Cynthia of the moment</i>,&rdquo;
       avow my passion, and swear eternal truth. Now I make no genuflection,
      offer no vows, and swear no oaths; and yet feel more than ever.&mdash;More!&mdash;dare
      I then place in the scale of comparison what I now feel with what I ever
      felt before? The thought is sacrilege!
    </p>
    <p>
      This child of Nature appears to me each succeeding day, in a <i>phasis</i>
      more bewitchingly attractive than the last. She now feels her power over
      me, (with woman&rsquo;s <i>intuition</i>, where the heart is in question!) and
      this consciousness gives to her manners a certain roguish tyranny, that
      renders her the most charming tantalizing being in the world. In a
      thousand little instances she contrives to teaze me; most, when most she
      delights me! and takes no pains to conceal my simple folly from others,
      while she triumphs in it herself. In short, she is the last woman in the
      world who would incur the risk of satiating him who is best in her love;
      for the variability of her manner, always governed by her ardent, though
      volatilized feelings, keeps suspense on the eternal <i>qui vive!</i> and
      the sweet assurance given by the eyes one moment, is destroyed in the next
      by some arch sally of the lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day I met her walking with the nurse. The old woman, very properly,
      made a motion to retire as I approached. Glorvina would not suffer this,
      and twined her arm round that of her fostermother. I was half inclined to
      turn on my heel, when a servant came running to the nurse for the keys. It
      was impossible to burst them from her side, and away she hobbled after the
      barefooted <i>laquais</i>. I looked reproachfully at Glorvina, but her
      eyes were fixed on an arbutus tree rich in blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had that high branch,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to put in my vase.&rdquo; In a
      moment I was climbing up the tree like a great school-boy, while she,
      standing beneath, received the blossoms in her extended drapery; and I was
      on the point of descending, when a branch, lovelier than all I had culled,
      attracted my eye: this I intended to present in <i>propria persona</i>,
      that I might get a kiss of the hand in return. With my own hands
      sufficiently engaged in effecting my descent, I held my Hesperian branch
      in my teeth, and had nearly reached the ground, when Glorvina playfully
      approached her lovely mouth to snatch the prize from mine. We were just in
      contact&mdash;I suddenly let fall the branch&mdash;and&mdash;Father John
      appeared walking towards us; while Glorvina, who, it seems, had perceived
      him before she had placed herself in the way of danger, now ran towards
      him, covered with blushes and malignant little smiles. In short, she makes
      me feel in a thousand trivial instances the truth of Epictetus&rsquo;s maxim,
      that to <i>bear</i> and <i>forbear</i>, are the powers that constitute a
      wise man: to <i>forbear</i>, alone, would, in my opinion, be a sufficient
      test.

    <h3>
      LETTER XXI.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> cannot promise
      you any more Irish history. I fear my <i>Hiberniana</i> is closed, and a
      volume of more dangerous, more delightful tendency, draws towards its
      bewitching subject every truant thought. To him who is deep in the <i>Philosophia
      Amatoria</i>, every other science is cold and vapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oral legend of the Prince, and the historic lore of the priest, all go
      for nothing! I shake my head, look very wise, and appear to listen, while
      my eyes are riveted on Glorvina&mdash;who, not unconscious of the ardent
      gaze, sweeps with a feathery touch the chords of her harp, or plies her
      fairy wheel with double vigilence. Meantime, however, I am making a rapid
      progress in the Irish language, and well I may; for besides that I now
      listen to the language of Ossian with the same respect a Hindoo would to
      the Sanscrit of the Bramins, the Prince, the priest, and even Glorvina,
      contribute their exertions to my progress. The other evening, as we
      circled round the evening fire in the great hall, the Prince would put my
      improvements to the test, and taking down a grammar, he insisted upon my
      conjugating a verb. The verb he chose was, &ldquo;<i>to love</i>&rdquo;&mdash;?
      &ldquo;Glorvina,&rdquo; said he, seeing me hesitate, &ldquo;go through the verb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina had it at her fingers&rsquo; ends; and in her eyes swam a thousand
      delicious comments on the text she was expounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, who is as unsuspicious as an infant, would have us repeat it
      together, that I might catch the pronunciation from her lip!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I love</i>,&rdquo; faintly articulated Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I love</i>,&rdquo; I more faintly repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not enough&mdash;the Prince would have us repeat the plural twice
      over: and again and again we murmured together&mdash;&ldquo;<i>we love!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heavens and earth! had you at that moment seen the preceptress and the <i>pupil!</i>The
      attention of the simple Prince was riveted on Valancy&rsquo;s grammar: he grew
      peevish at what he called our stupidity, and said we knew nothing of the
      verb to love, while in fact we were running through all its moods and
      tenses with our eyes and looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good God! to how many delicious sensations is the soul alive, for which
      there is no possible mode of expression..
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu.&mdash;The little post-boy is at my elbow. I observe he goes more
      frequently to the post than usual; and one morning I perceived Glorvina
      eagerly watching his return from the summit of a rock. Whence can this
      solicitude arise? Her father may have some correspondence on business&mdash;she
      can have none.

    <h3>
      LETTER XXII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his creature is
      deep in the metaphysics of love. She is perpetually awakening ardour by
      restraint, and stealing enjoyment from privation. She still persists in
      bringing the priest with her to the drawing-desk; but it is evident she
      does not the less enjoy that casual absence which leaves us sometimes
      alone; and I am now become such an epicure in sentiment, that I scarcely
      regret the restraint the presence of the priest imposes; since it gives a
      keener zest to the transient minutes of felicity his absence bestows&mdash;even
      though they are enjoyed in silent confusion. For nothing can be more
      seducing than her looks, nothing can be more dignified than her manners.
      If, when we are alone, I even offer to take her hand, she grows pale, and
      shrinks from my touch. Yet I regret not that careless confidence which
      once prompted the innocent request that I would guide her hand to draw a
      perpendicular line.

      &ldquo;Solitude (says the Spectator) with the person beloved, even to a woman&rsquo;s
      mind, has a pleasure beyond all the pomp and splendour in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O! how my heart subscribes to a sentiment I have so often laughed at, when
      my ideas of pleasure were very different from what they are at present. I
      cannot persuade myself that three weeks have elapsed since my return
      hither; and still less am I willing to believe that it is necessary I
      should return to M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house. In short, the rocks
      which embosom the peninsula of Inis-more bound all my hopes, all my
      wishes; and my desires, like the <i>radii of a circle</i>, all point
      towards one and the same centre. This creature grows on me with boundless
      influence; her originality, her genius, her sensibility, her youth, and
      person! In short, her united charms in this profound solitude thus closely
      associated, is a species of witchcraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indispensibly necessary I should return to M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;house,
      as my father&rsquo;s visit to Ireland is drawing near; and it was requisite I
      should receive and answer his letters. At last, therefore, I summoned up
      resolution to plead my former excuses to the Prince for my absence; who
      insisted on my immediate return&mdash;which I promised should be in a day
      or two&mdash;while the eyes of Glorvina echoed her father&rsquo;s commands, and
      mine looked implicit obedience. With what different emotions I now left
      Inismore, to those which accompanied my last departure! My feelings were
      then unknown to myself&mdash;now I am perfectly aware of their nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house, as usual, cold, comfortless,
      and desolate&mdash;with a few wretched-looking peasants working languidly
      about the grounds. In short, everything breathed the deserted mansion of
      an <i>absentee</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of my arrival I answered my father&rsquo;s letters&mdash;one from
      our pleasant but libertine friend D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n,&mdash;read over
      yours three times&mdash;went to bed&mdash;dreamed of Glorvina&mdash;and
      set off for Inismore the next morning. I rode so hard that I reached the
      castle about that hour which we usually devoted to the exertions of the
      pencil. I flew at once to that vast and gloomy room which her presence
      alone cheers and illumines. Her drawing-desk lay open; she seemed but just
      to have risen from the chair placed before it; and her work-basket hung on
      its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even this well-known little work-basket is to me an object of interest. I
      kissed the muslin it contained; and, in raising it, perceived a small book
      splendidly bound and gilt. I took it up, and read on its cover, marked in
      letters of gold, &ldquo;<i>Brevaire du Sentiment</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impelled by the curiosity which this title excited, I opened it&mdash;and
      found beneath its first two leaves several faded snowdrops <i>stained with
      blood</i>. Under them was written in Glorvina&rsquo;s hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Prone to the earth he bowed our pallid flowers&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And caught the drops divine, the purple dyes
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tinging the lustre of our native hues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A little lower in the page was traced, &ldquo;Culled from the spot where he fell&mdash;April
      the 1st, 17&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! how quickly my bounding heart told me who was that <i>he</i>, whose
      vital drops had stained these <i>treasured</i> blossoms, thus &ldquo;tinging the
      lustre of their native hues.&rdquo; While the sweetest association of ideas
      convinced me that these were the identical flowers which Glorvina had
      hallowed with a tear as she watched by the couch of him with whose blood
      they were polluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I pressed this sweet testimony of a pure and lively tenderness to my
      lips, she entered. At sight of <i>me</i>, pleasurable surprise invested
      every feature; and the most innocent joy lit up her countenance, as she
      sprang forward and offered me her hand. While I carried it eagerly to my
      lips, I pointed to the snowdrops. Glorvina, with the hand which was
      disengaged, covered her blushing face, and would have fled. But the look
      which preceded this natural motion discovered the wounded feelings of a
      tender but proud heart. I felt the indelicacy of my conduct, and, still
      clasping her struggling hand, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive, forgive the vain triumph of a being intoxicated by your pity&lt;&mdash;transported
      by your condescension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Triumph!</i>&rdquo; repeated Glorvina, in an accent tenderly reproachful,
      yet accompanied by a look proudly indignant&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Triumph!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How I cursed the coxcomical expression in my heart, while I fell at her
      feet, and kissing the hem of her robe, without daring to touch the hand I
      had relinquished, said, &ldquo;Does this look like triumph, Glorvina?&rdquo; Glorvina
      turned towards me a face in which all the witcheries of her sex were
      blended&mdash;playful fondness, affected anger, animated tenderness, and
      soul-dissolving languishment. Oh! she should not have looked thus, or I
      should have been more or less than man.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a glance of undeniable supplication, she released herself from that
      glowing fold, which could have pressed her forever to a heart where she
      must forever reign unrivalled. I saw she wished I should think her very
      angry, and another pardon was to be solicited, for the transient
      indulgence of that passionate impulse her own seducing looks had called
      into existence. The pardon, after some little pouting playfulness, <i>was</i>
      granted, and I was suffered to lead her to that Gothic sofa where our
      first <i>tete-a-tete</i> had taken place; and partly by artifice, partly
      by entreaty, I drew from her the little history of the treasured
      snow-drops, and read from her eloquent eyes more than her bashful lip
      would dare to express.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, like the <i>assymtotes</i> of a hyperbola, without absolutely
      rushing into contact, we are, by a sweet impulsion, gradually
      approximating closer and closer towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! my dear friend, this is the golden age of love; and I sometimes think,
      with the refined Weiland, in certain degree, with the first kiss&mdash;mine,
      therefore, is now in its climacteric.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impetuosity with which I rush on every subject that touches her, often
      frustrates the intention with which I sit down to address you. I left this
      letter behind me unfinished, for the purpose of filling it up, on my
      return, with answers to those I expected to receive from you. The
      arguments which your friendly foresight and prudent solicitude have
      furnished you, are precisely such as the understanding cannot refute, nor
      the heart subscribe to.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say my <i>wife</i> she <i>cannot</i> be&mdash;and my mistress! perish
      the thought! What! I repay the generosity of the father by the destruction
      of the child! I steal this angelic being from the peaceful security of her
      native shades, with all her ardent, tender feelings thick upon her: I,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Crop this fair rose, and rifle all its sweetness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No; you do me but common justice when you say, that though you have
      sometimes known me <i>affect</i> the character of a libertine, yet never,
      even for a moment, have you known me forfeit that of a man of honour. I
      would not be understood to speak in the mere commonplace worldly
      acceptation of the word, but literally, according to the text of moral and
      divine laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, what,&rdquo; you ask me, &ldquo;is the aim, the object, in pursuing this <i>ignus
      fatuus</i> of the heart and fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a word, then, virtue is my object&mdash;felicity my aim; or, rather, I
      am lured towards the former through the medium of the latter. And whether
      the tie which binds me at once to moral and physical good, is a fragile
      texture and transient existence, or whether it will become &ldquo;close twisted
      with the fibres of the heart, and breaking break it,&rdquo; time only can
      determine&mdash;to time, therefore, I commit my fate; but while thus led
      by the hand of virtue, I inebriate at the living spring of bliss;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;While reeling through a wilderness of joy,"= can you wonder that I fling
      off the goading chain of prudence, and, in daring to be <i>free</i>, at
      once be virtuous and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s letter is brief, but pithy. My brother is married, and has
      sold his name and <i>title</i> for a hundred thousand pounds; and <i>his</i>
      brother has a chance of selling his happiness forever for something about
      the same sum. And who think you, is to be the purchaser? Why our old
      sporting friend D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. In my last grousing visit
      at his seat, you may remember the <i>pert</i> little girl, his only
      daughter, who, he assured us, was that day <i>unkennelled</i> for the
      first time, in honour of our success, and who rushed upon us from the
      nursery in all the bloom of fifteen, and all the boldness of a hoyden;
      whose society was the house-keeper, and the chamber-maid, whose ideas of
      pleasure extended no farther than a blind-man&rsquo;s-buff in the servant&rsquo;s
      hall, and a game of hot cockles with the butler and footman in the pantry.
      I had the good fortune to touch her heart at cross-purposes, and
      completely vanquished her affection by a romping match in the morning; and
      so it seems the fair <i>susceptible</i> has pined in thought ever since,
      but not &ldquo;let concealment prey on her damask cheek,&rdquo; for she told her love
      to an old maiden aunt, who told it to another confidential friend, until
      the whole neighbourhood was full of the tale of the <i>victim of constancy</i>
      and the <i>fatal deceiver</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father, as is usual in such cases, was the last to hear it; and
      believing me to be an excellent shot, and a keen sportsman, all he
      requires in a son-in-law, except a good family, he proposed the match to
      my father, who gladly embraced the offer, and fills his letters with
      blossoms, blushes, and unsophisticated charms; congratulates me on my
      conquest, and talks either of recalling me shortly to England, or bringing
      the fair <i>fifteen</i> and old <i>Nimrod</i> to Ireland on a visit with
      him. But the former he will not easily effect, and the latter I know
      business will prevent for some weeks, as he writes that he is still up to
      his ears in parchment deeds, leases, settlements, jointures. Mean time,
    </p>

      &ldquo;Song, beauty, youth, love, virtue, joy, this group
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of bright ideas, flowers of Paradise as yet unforfeit,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      crown my golden hours of bliss; and whatever may be my destiny, I will at

      oh! my good friend, there is a prophetic something which incessantly
      whispers me, that in clouds and storms will the evening of my existence
      expire.

    <h3>
      LETTER XXIII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is certain, that
      you men of the world are nothing less than men of <i>pleasure</i>:&mdash;would
      you taste it in all its essence, come to Inismore. Ah! no, pollute not
      with your presence the sacred <i>palladium</i> of all the primeval
      virtues; and attempt not to participate in those pure joys of the soul it
      would be death in me to divide even with you
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Plato might enjoy, and Epicurus revel: here we are taught to feel
      according to t. doctrine of the latter, that the happiness of mankind
      consists in <i>pleasure</i>, not such as arises from gratification of the
      senses, or the pursuits of vice&mdash;but from the enjoyments of the mind,
      the pleasures of the imagination, the affections of the heart and the
      sweets of virtue. And here we learn, according to the precepts of the
      former, that the summit of human felicity may be attained, by removing
      from the material, and approaching nearer to the intellectual world; by
      curbing and governing the passions, which are so much oftener inflamed by
      imaginary than real objects; and by borrowing from temperance, that zest
      which can alone render pleasure forever poignant and forever new. Ah! you
      will say, like other lovers, you now see the moral as well as the natural
      world through a prism; but would this unity of pleasure and virtue be
      found in the wilds of Inismore, if Glorvina was no longer there?
    </p>
    <p>
      I honestly confess to you I do not think it would, for where yet was
      pleasure ever found where woman was not? and when does the heart so warmly
      receive the pure impressions of virtue, as when its essence is imbibed
      from woman&rsquo;s lip?
    </p>
    <p>
      My life passes away here in a species of delectability to which I can give
      no name; and while, through the veil of delicate reserve which the pure
      suggestions of the purest nature have flung over the manners of my sweet
      Glorvina, a thousand little tendernesses unconsciously appear. Her amiable
      preceptor clings to me with a parent&rsquo;s fondness; and her father&rsquo;s
      increasing partiality for his hereditary enemy, is visible in a thousand
      instances; while neither of these excellent, but inexperienced men,
      suspect the secret intelligence which exists between the younger tutor and
      his lovely pupil. As yet, indeed, it has assumed no determinate character.
      With me it is a delightful dream, from which I dread to be awakened, yet
      feel that it is but a dream; while she, bewildered, amazed at those vague
      emotions which throb impetuously in her unpractised heart, resigns herself
      unconsciously to the sweetest of all deliriums, and makes no effort to
      dissolve the vision!
    </p>
    <p>
      If, in the refined epicurism of my heart, I carelessly speak of my
      departure for England in the decline of summer, Glorvina changes colour;
      the sainted countenance of Father John loses its wonted smile of
      placidity; and the Prince replies by some peevish observation on the
      solitude of their lives, and the want of attraction at Inis more to detain
      a man of the world in its domestic circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he will say, &ldquo;it was not always thus&mdash;this hall once echoed to
      the sound of mirth and the strain of gaiety; for the day was, when none
      went sad of heart from the castle of Inismore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I much fear that the circumstances of this worthy man are greatly
      deranged, though it is evident his pride would be deeply wounded if it was
      even suspected. Father John, indeed, hinted to me, that the Prince was a
      great agricultural speculator some few years back; &ldquo;and even still&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;likes to hold more land in his hands than he is able to manage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have observed, too, that the hall is frequently crowded with importunate
      people whom the priest seems endeavouring to pacify in Irish; and twice,
      as I passed the Prince&rsquo;s room last week, an ill-looking fellow appeared at
      the door whom Glorviria was showing out. Her eyes were moist with tears,
      and at the sight of me she deeply coloured, and hastily withdrew. It is
      impossible to describe my feelings at that moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding, however, the Prince affects an air of grandeur, and
      opulence&mdash;he keeps a kind of open table in his servants&rsquo; hall, where
      a crowd of labourers, dependants, and mendicants are daily entertained; *
      and it is evident his pride would receive a mortal stab, if he supposed
      that his guest, and that guest an Englishman, suspected the impoverished
      state of his circumstances.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The kitchen, or servants&rsquo; hall of an Irish country
     gentleman, is open to all whom distress may lead to its
     door. Professed indolent mendicants take advantage of this
     indiscriminating hospitality, enter without ceremony, seat
     themselves by the fire, and seldom (indeed never) depart
     with their demands unsatisfied, by the misapplied
     benevolence of an old Irish custom, which in many instances
     would be&mdash;&ldquo;more honoured in the breach than the observance.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Although not a man of very superior understanding, yet he evidently
      possesses that innate grandeur of soul, which haughtily struggles with
      distress, and which will neither yield to, nor make terms with misfortune;
      and when, in the dignity of that pride which scorns revelation of its
      woes, I behold him collecting all the forces of his mind, and asserting a
      right to a better fate, I feel my own character energize in the
      contemplation of his, and am almost tempted to envy him those trials which
      call forth the latent powers of human fortitude and human greatness.

      assail my full all-confiding heart. And yet I am jealous only on surmise:
      but who was ever jealous on conviction; for where is the heart so weak, so
      mean as to cherish the passion when betrayed by the object? I have already
      mentioned to you the incongruities which so forcibly struck me in
      Glorvina&rsquo;s <i>boudoir</i>. Since the evening, the happy evening in which I
      first visited it, I have often stolen thither when I knew her elsewhere
      engaged, but always found it locked till this morning, when I perceived
      the door standing open. It seemed as though its mistress had but just left
      it, for a chair was placed near the window, which was open, and her book
      and work-basket lay on the seat. I mechanically took up the book, it was
      my own <i>Eloisa</i>, and was marked with a slip of paper in that page
      where the character of Wolmar is described; I read through the passage, I
      was throwing it by, when some writing on the <i>paper mark</i> caught my
      eye; supposing it to be Glorvina&rsquo;s, I endeavoured to decypher the lines,
      and read as follows: &ldquo;Professions, my lovely friend, are for the world.
      But I would at least have you believe that <i>my</i> friendship, like
      gold, though not <i>sonorous</i>, is indestructible.&rdquo; This was all I could
      make out&mdash;and this I read a hundred times&mdash;the hand-writing was
      a man&rsquo;s&mdash;but it was not the priest&rsquo;s&mdash;it could not be her
      father&rsquo;s. And yet I thought the hand was not entirely unknown to me,
      though it appeared disguised. I was still engaged in gazing on the <i>sybil
      leaf</i> when I heard <i>Glorvina</i> approach. I never was mistaken in
      her little feet&rsquo;s light bound, for she seldom walks; and hastily replacing
      the book, I appeared deeply engaged in looking over a fine atlas that lay
      open on the table. She seemed surprised at my appearance, so much so, that
      I felt the necessity for apologizing for my intrusion. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;an
      immunity granted by you is too precious to be neglected, and if I have not
      oftener availed myself of my valued privileges, I assure you the fault was
      not mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without noticing my inuendo she only bowed her head, and asked me with a
      smile, &ldquo;what favourite spot on the globe I was tracing with such
      earnestness,&rdquo; when her entrance had interrupted my geographic pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I placed my finger on that point of the northwest shores of Ireland, where
      we then stood, and said in the language of <i>St. Preux</i>, &ldquo;The world,
      in my imagination, is divided into two regions&mdash;that where <i>she is</i>&mdash;and
      that where she is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an air of bewitching insinuation, she placed her hand on my shoulder,
      and with a faint blush and a little smile shook her head, and looked up in
      my face, with a glance half incredulous&mdash;half tender. I kissed the
      hand by whose pressure I was thus honoured, and said, &ldquo;professions, my
      lovely friend, are for the world, but I would at least have you believe,
      that my friendship, like gold, though not sonorous, is indestructible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I said, in the irrascibility of my jealous heart, for, though too
      warm for another, oh! how cold for me! Glorviria started as I spoke, I
      thought changed colour! while at intervals she repeated, &ldquo;strange!&mdash;nor
      is this the only coincidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coincidence!&rdquo; I eagerly repeated, but she affected not to hear me, and
      appeared busily engaged in selecting for herself a bouquet from the
      flowers which filled one of those <i>vases</i> I before noticed to you.
      &ldquo;And is that beautiful vase,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;another family antiquity? it looks
      as though it stole its elegant form from an Estrucan model: is this too an
      effort of ancient Irish taste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, I thought confusedly, &ldquo;I believe it came from Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been long in the possession of the family?&rdquo; said I, with
      persevering impertinence. &ldquo;It was a present from a friend of my father&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
       she replied, colouring, &ldquo;to me!&rdquo; The bell at that moment rang for
      breakfast, away she flew, apparently pleased to be released from my
      importunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of her father&rsquo;s!&rdquo; and who can this friend be, whose delicacy of
      judgment so nicely adapts the gifts to the taste of her on whom they are
      lavished. For, undoubtedly, the same hand that made the offering of the
      vases, presented also those other portable elegancies which are so
      strongly contrasted by the rude original furniture of the <i>Boudoir</i>.
      The tasteful <i>donneur</i> and author of that letter whose torn fragment
      betrayed the sentiment of no common mind, are certainly one and the same
      person. Yet, who visits the castle? scarcely any one; the pride and
      circumstances of the <i>Prince</i> equally forbid it. Sometimes, though
      rarely, an old Milesian cousin, or poor relation will drop in, but those
      of them that I have seen, are mere commonplace people. I have indeed heard
      the Prince speak of a cousin in the Spanish service, and a nephew in the
      Irish brigades, now in Germany. But the cousin is an old man, and the
      nephew he has not seen since he was a child. Yet, after all, these
      presents may have come from one of those relatives; if so, as Glorvina has
      no recollection of either, how I should curse that jealous temper which
      has purchased for me some moments of torturing doubts. I remember you used
      often to say, that any woman could <i>pique</i> me into love by affecting
      indifference, and that the native jealousy of my disposition would always
      render me the slave of any woman who knew how to play upon my dominant
      passion. The fact is, when my heart erects an idol for its secret homage,
      it is madness to think that another should even bow at the shrine, much
      less that his offerings should be propitiously received.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is the silence of Glorvina on the subject of this generous friend,
      that distracts me; if, after all&mdash;oh! it is impossible&mdash;it is
      sacrilege against heaven to doubt her! She practised in deception! she,
      whose every look, every motion betrays a soul that is all truth,
      innocence, and virtue! I have endeavoured to sound the priest on the
      subject, and affected to admire the vases; repeating the same questions
      with which I had teased Glorvina. But he, too, carelessly replied, &ldquo;they
      were given her by a friend of her father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ust as I had
      finished my last, the Prince sent for me to his room; I found him alone,
      and sitting up in his bed! he only complained of the effects of years and
      sickness, but it was evident that some recent cause of uneasiness preyed
      on his mind. He made me sit by his bed-side, and said, that my
      good-nature, upon every occasion, induced him to prefer a request, he was
      induced to hope would not meet with a denial. I begged he would change
      that request to a command, and rely in every instance on my readiness to
      serve him. He thanked me, and told me in a few words, that the priest was
      going on a very particular, but not very pleasing business for him (the
      Prince) to the <i>north</i>; that the journey was long, and would be both
      solitary and tedious to his good old friend, whose health I might have
      observed was delicate and precarious, except I had the goodness to cheat
      the weariness of the journey by giving the priest my company. &ldquo;I would not
      make the request,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but that I think your compliance will be
      productive of pleasure and information to yourself; in a journey of a
      hundred miles, many new sources of observation to your inquiring mind will
      appear. Besides, you who seem to feel so lively an interest in all which
      concerns this country, will be glad to have an opportunity of viewing the
      Irish character in a new aspect; or rather of beholding the Scotch
      character engrafted upon ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Prince, with his usual nationality, &ldquo;that exotic branch is
      not very distinguishable from the old stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I need not tell you that I complied with this request with <i>seeming</i>
      readiness, but with real reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, as we circled round the fire in the great hall, I proposed
      to <i>Father John</i> to accompany him on his journey the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man was overjoyed at the offer while Glorvina betrayed neither
      surprise nor regret at my intention, but looked first at her father, and
      then at me, with kindness and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were my heart more at ease, were my confidence in the affections of
      Glorvina something stronger, I should greatly relish this little tour, but
      as it is, when I found every thing arranged for my departure, without the
      concurrence of my own wishes, I could not check my pettishness, and for
      want of some other mode of venting it, I endeavoured to ridicule a work on
      the subject of <i>ancient Irish</i> history which the priest was reading
      aloud, while Glorvina worked, and I was trifling with my pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said I, after having interrupted him in many different passages,
      which I thought savoured of natural hyperbole, &ldquo;what can be more forced
      than the very supposition of your partial author, that <i>Albion</i>, the
      most ancient name of Britain, was given it as though it were another or <i>second
      Ireland</i>, because Banba was one of the ancient names of your country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may appear to you a forced etymology,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;yet it has
      the sanction of <i>Camden</i>, who first risked the supposition. But it is
      the fate of our unhappy country to receive as little credit in the present
      day, for its former celebrity, as for its great antiquity, * although the
      former is attested by <i>Bede</i>, and many other early British writers,
      and the latter is authenticated by the testimony of the most ancient Greek
      authors. For <i>Jervis</i> is mentioned in the <i>Argonautica</i> of <i>Orpheus</i>,
      long before the name of England is anywhere to be found in Grecian
      literature. And surely it had scarcely been first mentioned, had it not
      been first known.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  It has been the fashion to throw odium on the modern
     Irish, by undermining the basis of their ancient history,
     and vilifying their ancient national character. If a
     historian professes to have acquired his information from
     the records of the country whose history he writes, his
     accounts are generally admitted as authentic, as the
     commentaries of Garcilasso de Vega are considered as the
     chief pillars of Peruvian history, though avowed by their
     author to have been compiled from the old national ballads
     of the country; yet the old writers of Ireland, (the Psalter
     of Cashel in particular) though they refer to these ancient
     re cords of their country, authenticated by existing manners
     and existing habits, are plunged into the oblivion of
     contemptuous neglect, or read only to be discredited.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really suppose,&rdquo; said I, smiling incredulously, &ldquo;we are indebted
      to you for the name of our country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the priest, returning my smile, &ldquo;the fallacies in general
      of all etymologists, but the only part of your island anciently called by
      any name that bore the least affinity to <i>Albion</i>, was <i>Scotland</i>,
      then called <i>Albin</i>, a word of <i>Irish</i> etymology, <i>Albin</i>
      signifying mountainous, from Alb, a mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear friend,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;admitting the great antiquity of your
      country, allowing it to be early inhabited by a lettered and civilized
      people, and that it was the <i>Nido paterno</i> of western literature when
      the rest of Europe was involved in darkness; how is it that so few
      monuments of your ancient learning and genius remain? Where are your
      manuscripts, your records, your annals, stamped with the seal of antiquity
      to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manuscripts, annals, and records are not the treasures of a colonized or
      conquered country,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;it is always the policy of the
      conqueror, or the invader, to destroy those mementi of ancient national
      splendour which keep alive the spirit of the conquered or the invaded; *
      the dispersion at various periods ** of many of the most illustrious Irish
      families into foreign countries, has assisted the depredations of time and
      policy, in the plunder of her literary treasures; many of them are now
      mouldering in public and private libraries on the Continent, whither their
      possessors conveyed them from the destruction which civil war carries with
      it, and many of them (even so far back as Elizabeth&rsquo;s day) were conveyed
      to Denmark. The Danish monarch applied to the English court for some
      learned men to translate them, and one <i>Donald O&rsquo;Daly</i>, a person
      eminently qualified for the task, was actually engaged to perform it,
      until the illiberality of the English court prevented the intention on the
      poor plea of its prejudicing the English interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sir George Carevy, in the reign of Elizabeth, was accused
     of bribing the family historian of the McCarthies to convey
     to him some curious MSS. &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; says the author of the
     Analect, &ldquo;Carevy did in one province [Munster] Henry Sidney,
     and his predecessors did all over the kingdom, being charged
     to collect all the manuscripts they could, that they might
     effectually destroy every vestige of antiquity and letters
     throughout the Kingdom.&rdquo; And St. Patrick, in his apostolic
     zeal, committed to the flames several hundred druidical
     volumes.

     ** Fourteen thousand Irish took advantage of the articles of
     Limerick, and bade adieu to their native country forever.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know myself that many of our finest and most valuable MSS. are in
      libraries in France, and have heard, that not a few of them enrich the
      Vatican at Rome.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In a conversation which passed in Cork between the
     author&rsquo;s father and the celebrated Dr. O&rsquo;Leary, the latter
     said he had once intended to have written a history of
     Ireland. And added, &ldquo;but, in truth, I found, after various
     researches, that I could not give such a history as I would
     wish should come from my pen, without visiting the
     Continent, more particularly Rome, where alone the best
     documents for the history of Ireland are to be had. But it
     is now too late in the day for me to think of such a journey
     or such exertions as the task would require.&rdquo;

     &ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran informs me [says Mr. Walker, in his Memoirs of the
     Irish Bards, p. 141], that he lately got in a collection
     from Rome, several poems of the most eminent Bards of last
     centuries.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are not many of those MSS. supposed to be monkish
      impositions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;by those who <i>never saw them</i>, and if <i>they
      did</i>, were too ignorant of the Irish language to judge of their
      authenticity by the internal evidences they contain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if they were the works of monks,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;Ireland was
      always allowed to possess at that era the most devout and learned
      ecclesiastics in Europe, from which circumstance it received its title of
      <i>Island of Saints</i>. By them, indeed, many histories of the ancient
      Irish were composed in the early ages of Christianity, but it was
      certainly from Pagan records and traditions they received their
      information; besides, I do not think any arguments can be advanced more
      favourable to the histories, than that the fiction of those histories
      simply consists in ascribing natural phenomena to supernatural agency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; returned I, &ldquo;granting that your island was the <i>Athens</i> of a
      certain age, how is the barbarity of the present day to be reconciled with
      the civilization of the enlightened past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you talk of our <i>barbarity</i>,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;you do not
      speak as you <i>feel</i>, but as you <i>hear</i>.&rdquo; I blushed at this mild
      reproof, and said, &ldquo;what I <i>now</i> feel for this country, it would not
      be easy to express, but l have always been taught to look upon the <i>inferior</i>
      Irish as beings forming an humbler link than humanity in the chain of
      nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;in your country it is usual to attach to that
      class of society in ours a ferocious disposition amounting to barbarity;
      but this, with other calumnies, of national indolence, and obstinate
      ignorance, of want of principle, and want of faith, is unfounded and
      illiberal; * &lsquo;cruelty,&rsquo; says Lord Sheffield, &lsquo;is not in the nature of
      these people more than of other men, for they have many customs among them
      which disprove of unnatural indolence, that they are constitutionally of
      an active nature, and capable of the greatest exertions; and of as good
      dispositions as any nation in the same state of improvement; their
      generosity, hospitality, and bravery are proverbial; intelligence and zeal
      in whatever they undertake will never be wanting:&mdash;? <i>It has been
      the fashion to judge of them by their outcasts</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * When nature is wounded through all her dearest ties, she
     must turn on the hand that stabs, and endeavour to wrest the
     poignard from the grasp that aims at the life-pulse of her
     heart. And this she will do in obedience to that immutable
     law, which blends the instinct of self-preservation with
     every atom of human existence. And for this, in less
     felicitous times, when oppression and sedition succeeded
     alternately to each other, was the name of Irishman, blended
     with the horrible epithet of cruel But when the sword of the
     oppressor was sheathed, the spirit of the oppressed reposed,
     and the opprobrium it had drawn down on him was no longer
     remembered, until the unhappy events of a late anarchial
     period, 1798 revived the faded characters in which that
     opprobrium had been traced. The events alluded to were the
     atrocities which chiefly occurred in the county of Wexford,
     and its adjoining and confederate district. Wexford is an
     English colony, planted by Henry the Second, where scarcely
     any feature of the original Irish character, or any trace of
     the Irish language is to be found. While in the barony of
     Forth, not only the customs, manners, habits, and costume,
     of the ancient British settlers still prevail, but the
     ancient Celtic language, has been preserved with infinitely
     less corruption than in any part of Britain, where it has
     been interwoven with the Saxon, Danish, and French
     languages. In fact, here may be found a remnant of an
     ancient. British colony, more pure and unmixed than in any
     other part of the world. And here were committed those
     barbarities, which have recently attached the epithet of
     cruel to the name of Irishman!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange (said the Prince,) that the earliest British writers should
      be as diffuse in the praise, as the moderns are in calumniating our
      unhappy country. Once we were everywhere, and by all, justly famed for our
      patriotism, ardour of affection, love of letters, skill in arms and arts,
      and refinement of manners; but no sooner did there arise a connexion
      between us and a sister country, than the reputed virtues and well-earned
      glory of the Irish sunk at once into oblivion: as if (continued this
      enthusiastic <i>Milesian</i>, rising from his seat with all his native
      vehemence,)&mdash;as if the moral world was subject to those convulsions
      which shake the <i>natural</i> to its centre, burying by a single shock
      the monumental splendours of countless ages. Thus it should seem, that
      when the bosom of national freedom was rent asunder, the national virtues
      which derived their nutriment from its source sunk into the abyss; while
      on the barren surface which covers the wreck of Irish greatness, the hand
      of prejudice and illiberality has sown the seeds of calumny and
      defamation, to choke up those healthful plants, indigenous to the soil,
      which still raise their oft-crushed heads, struggling for existence, and
      which, like the palm-tree, rise, in proportion to those efforts made to
      suppress them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To repeat the words of the Prince is to deprive them of half their effect:
      his great eloquence lies in his air, his gestures, and the forcible
      expression of his dark-rolling eye. He sat down exhausted with the
      impetuous vehemence with which he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were to believe Dr. Warner, however,&rdquo; (said the priest) &ldquo;the modern
      Irish are a degenerated race, comparatively speaking, for he asserts, that
      even in the days of Elizabeth, &lsquo;the old natives had degenerated, and that
      the <i>wars of several centuries</i> had reduced them to a state far
      inferior to that in which they were found in the days of Henry the
      Second.&rsquo; But still, like the modern Greeks, we perceive among them strong
      traces of a free, a great, a polished, and an enlightened people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wearied by a conversation in which my heart now took little interest, I
      made the <i>palinod</i> of my <i>prejudices</i>, and concluded by saying,
      &ldquo;I perceive that on this ground I am always destined to be vanquished, yet
      always to win by the loss, and gain by the defeat; and therefore I ought
      not in common policy to cease to <i>oppose</i>, until nothing further can
      be obtained by opposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, who was getting a little testy at my &ldquo;<i>heresy</i> and <i>schism</i>,&rdquo;
       seemed quite appeased by this avowal; and the priest, who was gratified by
      a compliment I had previously paid to his talents, shook me heartily by
      the hand, and said, I was the most generous opponent he had ever met with.
      Then taking up his book, was suffered to proceed in its perusal
      uninterupted. During the whole of the evening, Glorvina maintained an
      uninterrupted silence; she appeared lost in thought, and unmindful of our
      conversation, while her eyes, sometimes turned on me, but oftener on her
      father, seemed humid with a tear, as she contemplated his lately much
      altered appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when the debility of the man was for a moment lost in the energy of
      the patriot, I perceived the mind of the daughter kindling at the sacred
      fire which illumined the father&rsquo;s; and through the tear of natural
      affection sparkled the bright beam of national enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suspect that the embassy of the good priest is not of the most pleasant
      nature. To-night as he left me at the door of my room, he said that we had
      a long journey before us; for that the house of the nobleman to whom we
      are going lay in a remote part of the province of Ulster; that he was a
      Scotchman, and only occasionally visited this country (where he had an
      immense property) to receive his rents. &ldquo;The Prince (said he) holds a
      large but unprofitable farm from this Highland chief, the lease of which
      he is anxious to throw up: that surly looking fellow who dined with us the
      other day, is a steward; and if the master is as inexorable as the
      servant, we shall undertake this journey to very little purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adieu.&mdash;I endeavour to write and think on every subject but that
      nearest my heart, yet <i>there</i> Glorvina and her mysterious friend
      still awaken the throb of jealous doubt and anxious solicitude. I shall
      drop this for you in the postoffice of the first post-town I pass through;
      and probably endeavour to forget myself, and my anxiety to return hither,
      at your expense, by writing to you in the course of my journey.

      LETTER XXVI.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>an you recollect
      who was that rational, moderate youth, who exclaimed in the frenzy of
      passion, &ldquo;O gods! annihilate both <i>time</i> and <i>space</i>, and make
      two lovers happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I should indeed wish the hours annihilated till I again
      behold Glorvina; but for the space which divides us, it was requisite I
      should be fifty miles from her, to be no more entirely with her; to
      appreciate the full value of her society; and to learn the nature of those
      wants my heart must ever feel when separated from her. The priest and I
      arose this morning with the sun. Our lovely hostess was ready at the
      breakfast-table to receive us. I was so selfish as to observe without
      regret the air of langour that invested her whole form, and the heaviness
      that weighed down her eyelids, as though the influence of sleep had not
      renovated the lustre of those downcast eyes they veiled. Ah! if I dared
      believe that these wakeful hours were given to me. But I fear at that
      moment her heart was more occupied by her father than her lover: for I
      have observed, in a thousand instances, the interest she takes in his
      affairs; and indeed the priest hinted to me, that her good sense has
      frequently retrieved those circumstances the imprudent speculations of her
      father have as constantly deranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      During breakfast she spoke but little, and once I caught her eyes turned
      full on me, with a glance in which tenderness, regret, and even something
      of despondency were mingled. Glorvina despond! So young, so lovely, so
      virtuous, and so highly gifted! Oh! at that moment had I been master of
      worlds! but, dependent myself on another&rsquo;s will, I could only sympathize
      in the sufferings while I adored the sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arose to depart, Glorvina said, &ldquo;If you will lead your horses I
      will walk to the drawbridge with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delighted at the proposal, we ordered our horses to follow us; and with an
      arm of Glorvina drawn through either of ours, we left the castle. &ldquo;This
      (said I, pressing the hand which rested on mine,) is commencing a journey
      under favourable auspices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it may be so,&rdquo; said Glorvina, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; I repeated; and looking at Glorvina, read all the daughter in her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall sleep to-night, (said the priest, endeavouring to dissipate the
      gloom which hung over us by indifferent chit-chat;) we shall sleep
      to-night at the hospitable mansion of a true-born <i>Milesian</i>, to whom
      I have the honour to be distantly allied; and where you will find the old
      <i>Brehon</i> law, which forbids that a sept should be disappointed of the
      expected feast, was no fabrication of national partiality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then, (said I,) we shall not enjoy ourselves in all the comfortable
      unrestrained freedom of <i>an inn</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We poor Irish, (said the priest,) find the unrestrained freedom of an inn
      not only in the house of a friend, but of every acquaintance, however
      distant; and indeed if you are at all known, you may travel from one end
      of a province to another, without entering a house of public
      entertainment; * the host always considering himself the debtor of the
      guest, as though the institution of the <i>Beataghs **</i> were still in
      being. And besides a cordial welcome from my hospitable kinsman, I promise
      you an introduction to his three handsome daughters. So fortify your
      heart, for I warn you it will run some risk before you return.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Not only have I been received with the greatest kindness,
     but I have been provided with everything which could promote
     the execution of my plan. In taking the circuit of Ireland,
     I have been employed eight or nine months; during which time
     I have been everywhere received with a hospitality which is
     nothing surprising in Ireland: that in such a length of time
     I have been but six times at an inn, will give a better idea
     of this hospitality than could be done by the most laboured
     praise.&rdquo;&mdash;M. de Latocknay.

     **  In the excellent system of the ancient Milesian
     government, the people were divided into classes; the
     Literati holding the next rank to royalty itself, and the
     Beataghs the fourth; so that, as in China, the state was so
     well regulated, that every one knew his place, from the
     prince to the peasant. &ldquo;These Beataghs (says Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran)
     were keepers of open houses for strangers, or poor
     distressed natives; and as honourable stipends were settled
     on the Literati, so were particular tracts of land on the
     Beataghs, to support, with proper munificence, their
     station; and there are lands and villages in many places to
     this day, which declare by their names their original
     appointment.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Glorvina, archly, &ldquo;I dare say that, like St. Paul, he will
      &lsquo;count it all joy to fall into divers temptations.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or rather, (returned I) I shall court them like the saints of old, merely
      to prove my powers of resistance; for I bear a charmed spell about me; and
      <i>now </i>&rsquo;none of <i>woman born</i> can harm <i>Macbeth</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what nature is your spell?&rdquo; said Glorvina, smiling, while the
      priest remained a little behind us talking to a peasant. &ldquo;Has Father John
      given you a gospel? or have you got an amulet, thrice passed through the
      <i>thrice blessed</i> girdle of St. Bridget, our great Irish charm?&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * On St Bridget&rsquo;s day it is usual for the young people to
     make a long girdle rope of straw, which they carry about to
     the neighbouring houses, and through it all those persons
     who have faith in the charm pass nine times, uttering at
     each time a certain form of prayer in Irish, which they thus
     conclude: &ldquo;If I enter this thrice-blessed girdle well, may I
     come out of it nine times better.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My charm (returned I) in some degree, certainly partakes of your
      religious and national superstitions; for since it was presented me by <i>your</i>
      hand, I could almost believe that its very essence has been changed by a
      touch!&rdquo; And I drew from my breast the withered remains of my once blooming
      rose. At that moment the priest joined us; and though Glorvina was silent,
      I felt the pressure of her arm more heavily on mine, and saw her pass the
      drawbridge without a recollection on her part that it was to have been the
      boundary of her walk. We had not, however, proceeded many paces, when the
      most wildly mournful sounds I ever heard rose on the air, and slowly died
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! (said Glorvina) some one is going to &lsquo;<i>that bourne from whence no
      traveller returns</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; As she spoke a hundred voices seemed to ascend to
      the skies; and as they subsided, a fainter strain lingered on the air, as
      though this truly savage choral sympathy was reduced to a recitative,
      chaunted by female voices. All that I had heard of the <i>Irish howl</i>,
      or funeral song, now rushed to my recollection; and turning at that moment
      the angle of the mountain of Inismore, I perceived a procession advancing
      towards a little cemetery, which lay by a narrow pathway to the left of
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body, in a plain deal coffin, covered with a white shirt, was carried
      by four men, immediately preceded by several old women covered in their
      mantles, and who sung at intervals in a wild and rapid tone. * Before them
      walked a number of young persons of both sexes, each couple holding by a
      white handkerchief, and strewing flowers along the path. An elderly woman,
      with eyes overflown with tears, dishevelled hair, and distracted mien,
      followed the body, uttering many passionate exclamations in Irish; and the
      procession was filled up by upwards of three hundred people; the
      recitative of the female choristers relieved at intervals by the combined
      howlings of the whole body. In one of the pauses of this dreadful
      death-chorus, I expressed to Glorvina my surprise at the multitude which
      attended the funeral of a peasant, while we stood on a bank as they passed
      us.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Speaking of the ancient Irish funeral, Mr. Walker
     observes;&mdash;&ldquo;Women, whose voices recommended them, were taken
     from the lower classes of life, and instructed in music, and
     cursios, or eligiac measure, that they might assist in
     heightening the melancholy which that ceremony was
     calculated to inspire. This custom prevailed among the
     Hebrews, from whom it is not improbable we had it
     immediately.&rdquo;

     Dr. Campbell is of opinion that the Ululate or hullalor of
     the choral burden of the Caoine, and the Greek word of the
     same import, have a strong affinity to each other.&mdash;Phil.
     Sur. South of Ireland, Letters 2, 3.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lower order of Irish,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;entertain a kind of posthumous
      pride respecting their funerals; and from sentiments that I have heard
      them express, I really believe there are many among them who would prefer
      living neglected to the idea of dying unmourned, or unattended, by a host
      to their last home.&rdquo; To my astonishment she then descended the bank, and,
      accompanied by the priest, mingled with the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will surprise you,&rdquo; said Glorvina; &ldquo;but it is wise to comply with
      those prejudices which we cannot vanquish. And by those poor people it is
      not only reckoned a mark of great disrespect not to follow a funeral (met
      by chance) a few paces, but almost a species of impiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mankind, you know,&rdquo; added the priest, &ldquo;are always more punctilious
      with respect to ceremonials than fundamentals. However, <i>you should</i>
      see an Irish Roman Catholic funeral; to a Protestant and a stranger it
      must be a spectacle of some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With respect to the attendant ceremonies on death,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I know
      of no country which the Irish at present resemble but the modern Greeks.
      In both countries when the deceased dies unmarried, the young attendants
      are chiefly dressed in white, carrying garlands, and strewing flowers as
      they proceed to the grave. Those old women who sing before the body are
      professional <i>improvisatori</i>; they are called <i>Caoiners</i> or <i>Keeners</i>,
      from the <i>Canine</i> or death song, and are <i>hired</i> to celebrate
      the virtues of the deceased. Thus we find St. Chrysostom censuring the
      Greeks of his day, for the purchased lamentations and hireling mourners
      that attend their funerals. And so far back with us as in the days of
      druidical influence, we find it was part of the profession of the bards to
      perform the funeral ceremonies, to sing to their harps the virtues of the
      dead, and call on the living to emulate their deeds. * This you may
      remember as a custom frequently alluded to in the poems of Ossian. ** Pray
      observe that frantic woman who tears her hair And beats her bosom: &rsquo;tis
      the mother of the deceased. She is following her only child to an early
      grave; and did you understand the nature of her lamentations you would
      compare them to the complaints of the mother of Euriales, in the Æneid:
      the same passionate expressions of sorrow, and the same wild extravagance
      of grief. They even still most religiously preserve here that custom never
      lost among the Greeks, of washing the body before interment, and strewing
      it with flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Caoine, or funeral song was, composed by the Filea of
     the departed, set to music by one of his oirfidegh, and sung
     over the grave by the racasaide, or rhapsodist, who
     accompanied his &ldquo;song of the tomb&rdquo; with the mourning murmur
     of his harp, while the inferior order of minstrels mingled
     their deep-toned chorus with the strain of grief, and the
     sighs of lamenting relatives breathed in unison to the
     tuneful sorrow. Thus was &ldquo;the stones of his fame,&rdquo; raised
     over the remains of the Irish chief with a ceremony
     resembling that with which the death of the Trojan hero was
     lamented,=
</pre>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;A melancholy choir attend around,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With plaintive sighs and music&rsquo;s solemn sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     But the singular ceremonies of the Irish funeral, which are
     even still in a certain degree extant, may be traced to a
     remoter antiquity than Grecian o right, for the pathetic
     lamentations of David for the friend of his soul, and the
     conclamatio breathed over the Phoenician Dido, has no faint
     coincidence to the Caoine or funeral song of the Irish.

     ** Thus over the tomb of Cucullin vibrated the song of the
     bard, &ldquo;Blessed be thy soul, son of Semo! thou wert mighty in
     battle; thy strength was like the strength of the stream,
     thy speed like the speed of the eagle&rsquo;s wing, thy path in
     battle was terrible, the steps of death were behind thy
     sword; blessed be thy soul son of Semo! Carborne ohicf of
     Dunscaith. The mighty were dispersed at Timo-ra&mdash;there is
     none in Cormac&rsquo;s hall. The king mourns in his youth, for he
     does not behold thy coming; the sound of thy shield is
     ceased, his foes are gathering around, Soft be thy rest in
     thy cave, chief of Erin&rsquo;s wars.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you also,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the funeral feast, which among the Greeks
      composed so material a part of the funeral ceremonies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>wake</i>, as it is called among us,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is at once the
      season of lamentation and sorrow, and of feasting and amusement. The
      immediate relatives of the deceased sit near the body, devoted to all the
      luxury of woe, which revives into the most piercing lamentations at the
      entrance of every stranger, while the friends, acquaintances, and guests
      give themselves up to a variety of amusements; feats of dexterity and even
      some exquisite pantomimes are performed; though in the midst of all their
      games should any one pronounce an <i>Ave Maria</i>, the merry group are in
      a moment on their knees; and the devotional impulse being gratified, they
      recommence their sports with new vigour. The <i>wake</i>, however, is of
      short duration; for here, as in Greece, it is thought an injustice to the
      dead to keep them long above ground; so that interment follows death with
      all possible expedition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had now reached the burial ground; near which the funeral was met by
      the parish priest, and the procession went three times round the cemetry,
      preceded by the priest, who repeated the <i>De profundis</i> as did all
      the congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ceremony,&rdquo; said Father John, &ldquo;is performed by us instead of the
      funeral service, which is denied to the Roman Catholics. For <i>we</i> are
      not permitted, like the Protestant ministers, to perform the last solemn
      office for our departed fellow creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke we entered the churchyard, and I expressed my surprise to
      Glorvina, who seemed wrapt in solemn meditation, at the singular
      appearance of this rustic little cemetery, where, instead of the
      monumental marble,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;The storied urn, or animated bust,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      an osier, twisted into the form of a cross, wreathed with faded foliage,
      garlands made of the pliant sally, twined with flowers; alone
      distinguished the &ldquo;narrow house,&rdquo; where
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Without answering, she led me gently forward towards a garland which
      seemed newly planted. We paused. A young woman who had attended the
      funeral, and withdrawn from the crowd, approached the garland at the same
      moment, and taking some fresh gathered flowers from her apron, strewed
      them over the new made grave, then kneeling beside it wept and prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the tomb of her lover,&rdquo; said I.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Of her father!</i>&rdquo; said
      Glorvina, in a voice whose affecting tone sunk to my heart, while her
      eyes, raised to heaven, were suffused with tears. The filial mourner now
      arose and departed, and we approached the simple shrine of her sorrowing
      devotion. Glorvina took from it a sprig of rosemary&mdash;its leaves were
      humid! &ldquo;It is not <i>all</i> dew,&rdquo; said Glorvina, with a sad smile, while
      her own tears fell on it, and she presented it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think me worthy of sharing in these divine feelings,&rdquo; I
      exclaimed, as I kissed off the sacred drops; while I was now confirmed in
      the belief that the tenderness, the sufferings, and declining health of
      her father, rendered him at that moment the sole object of her solicitude
      and affection. And with him only, could I, without madness, share the
      tender, sensible, angelic heart of this sweet interesting being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing her emotion increase, as she stood near the spot sacred to
      filial grief, I endeavoured to draw away her attention by remarking, that
      almost every tomb had now a votarist. &ldquo;It is a strong instance,&rdquo; said
      Glorvina, &ldquo;of the sensibility of the Irish, that they repair at intervals
      to the tombs of their deceased friends to drop a tender tear, or heave a
      heart-breathed sigh, to the memory of those so lamented in death, so dear
      to them in life. For my own part, in the stillness of a fine evening, I
      often wander towards this solemn spot, where the flowers newly thrown on
      the tombs, and weeping with the tears of departed day, always speak to my
      heart a tale of woe it feels and understands. While, as the breeze of
      evening mourns softly round me, I involuntarily exclaim, &lsquo;And when I shall
      follow the crowd that presses forward to eternity, what affectionate hand
      will scatter flowers over <i>my</i> solitary tomb? for haply, ere that
      period arrive, <i>my</i> trembling hand shall have placed the cypress on
      the tomb of him who alone loved me living, and would lament me dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alone</i>,&rdquo; I repeated, and pressing her hand to my heart,
      inarticulately added, &ldquo;Oh! Glorvina, did the pulses which now throb
      against each other, throb in unison, you would understand, that even <i>love</i>
      is a cold, inadequate term for the sentiments you have inspired in a soul,
      which would claim a closer kindred to yours than even parental affinity
      can assert; if (though but by a glance) yours would deign to acknowledge
      the sacred union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were standing in a remote part of the cemetery, under the shade of a
      drooping cypress&mdash;we were alone&mdash;we were unobserved. The hand of
      Glorvina was pressed to my heart, her head almost touched my shoulder, her
      lips almost effused their balmy sighs on mine. A glance was all I required&mdash;a
      glance was all I received.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the succeeding moments I know not what passed; for an interval all was
      delirium. Glorvina was the first to recover presence of mind; she released
      her hand which was still pressed to my heart, and, covered with blushes,
      advanced to Father John. I followed, and found her with her arm entwined
      in his, while those eyes, from whose glance my soul had lately quaffed the
      essence of life&rsquo;s richest bliss, were now studiously turned from me in
      love&rsquo;s own downcast bashfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Father Director now took my arm: and we were leaving this (to me)
      interesting spot&mdash;when the filial mourner, who had first drawn us
      from his side, approached the priest, and taking out a few shillings from
      the corner of her handkerchief, offered them to him, and spoke a few words
      in Irish; the priest returned her an answer and her money at the same
      time: she curtseyed low, and departed in silent and tearful emotion. At
      the same moment another female advanced towards us, and put a piece of
      silver and a little fresh earth into the hand of Father John; he blessed
      the earth and returned the little offering with it. The woman knelt and
      wept, and kissed his garment; then addressing him in Irish, pointed to a
      poor old man, who, apparently overcome with weakness, was reposing on the
      grass. Father John followed the woman, and advanced to the old man, while
      I, turning towards Glorvina, demanded an explanation of this extraordinary
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first of these poor creatures (said she) was offering the fruits of
      many an hour&rsquo;s labour, to have a mass said for the soul of her departed
      father, which she firmly believes will shorten his sufferings in
      purgatory: the last is another instance of weeping humanity stealing from
      the rites of superstition a solace from its woes. She brought that earth
      to the priest, that he might bless it ere it was flung into the coffin of
      a dear friend, who, she says, died this morning; for they believe that
      this consecrated earth is a substitute for those religious rites which are
      denied them on this awful occasion. And though these tender cares of
      mourning affection may originate in error, who would not pardon the
      illusion that soothes the sufferings of a breaking heart? Alas! I could
      almost envy these ignorant prejudices, which lead their possessors to
      believe, that by restraining their own enjoyments in this world, they can
      alleviate the sufferings, or purchase the felicity of the other for the
      objects of their tenderness and regret. Oh! that I could thus believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not, (said I, looking earnestly at her,) you do not receive
      all the doctrines of your church as infallible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina approached something closer towards me, and in a few words
      convinced me, that on the subject of religion, as upon every other, her
      strong mind discovered itself to be an emanation of that divine
      intelligence, which her pure soul worships &ldquo;in spirit and in truth,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The bright effulgence of bright essence uncreate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When she observed my surprise and delight, she added, &ldquo;believe me, my dear
      friend, the age in which religious error held her empire undisputed is
      gone by. The human mind, however slow, however opposed its progress, is
      still, by a divine and invariable law, propelled towards truth, and must
      finally attain that goal which reason has erected in every breast. Of the
      many who are the inheritors of <i>our</i> persuasion, <i>all</i> are not
      devoted to its errors, or influenced by its superstitions. If its
      professors are coalesced, it is in the sympathy of their destinies, not in
      the dogmas of their belief. If they are allied, it is by the tie of
      temporal interest, not by the bond of speculative opinion; they are united
      as <i>men</i>, not as sectaries; and once incorporated in the great mass
      of general society, their feelings will become diffusive as their
      interests; their affections, like their privileges, will be in common; the
      limited throb with which their hearts now beat towards each other, under
      the influence of a kindred fate, will then be animated to the nobler
      pulsation of universal philanthropy; and, as the acknowledged members of
      the first of all human communities they will forget they had ever been the
      <i>individual</i> adherents of an alienated body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest now returned to us, and was followed by the multitude, who
      crowded round this venerable and adored pastor: some to obtain his
      benediction for themselves, others his prayers for their friends, and all
      his advice or notice: while Glorvina, whom they had not at first
      perceived, stood like an idol in the midst of them, receiving that
      adoration which the admiring gaze of some, and the adulatory exclamations
      of others, offered to her virtues and her charms. While those personally
      known to her she addressed with her usually winning sweetness in their
      native language, I am sure that there was not an individual among this
      crowd of ardent and affectionate people, that would not risk their lives
      &ldquo;to avenge a look that threatened her with danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our horses now coming up to the gate of the cemetry, we insisted on
      walking back as far as the drawbridge with Glorvina. When we reached it,
      the priest saluted her cheek with paternal freedom, and gave her his
      blessing, while I was put off with an offer of the hand; but when, for the
      first time, I felt its soft clasp return the pressure of mine, I no longer
      envied the priest his cold salute; for oh! cold is every enjoyment which
      is unreciprocated. Reverberated bliss alone can touch the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had parted with Glorvina, and caught a last view of her receding
      figure, we mounted our horses, and proceeded a considerable way in
      silence. The morning though fine was gloomy; and though the sun was
      scarcely an hour high, we were met by innumerable groups of peasantry of
      both sexes, laden with their implements of husbandry, and already
      beginning the labours of the day. I expressed my surprise at observing
      almost as many women as men working in the fields and bogs. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
      the priest, &ldquo;toil is here shared in common between the sexes, the women as
      well as the men cut the turf, plant the potatoes, and even assist to
      cultivate the land; both rise with the sun to their daily labour; but his
      repose brings not theirs; for, after having worked all day for a very
      trivial remuneration, (as nothing here is rated lower than human labour,)
      they endeavour to snatch a beam from retreating twilight, by which they
      labour in that little spot of ground, which is probably the sole support
      of a numerous family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;idleness is the chief vice laid to the account of your
      peasantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;that there is not, generally speaking, that
      active spirit of industry among the inferior orders here, which
      distinguishes the same rank in England. But neither have they the same
      encouragement to awaken their exertions. &lsquo;The laziness of the Irish,&rsquo; says
      Sir William Petty, &lsquo;seems rather to proceed from want of employment and
      encouragement to work, than the constitution of their bodies.&rsquo; An
      intelligent and liberal countryman of yours, Mr. Young, the celebrated
      traveller, is persuaded that, circumstances considered, the Irish do not
      in reality deserve the character of indolence; and relates a very
      extraordinary proof of their great industry and exertion in their method
      of procuring lime for manure, which the mountaineers bring on the backs of
      their little horses many miles distance, to the foot of the steepest
      acclivities, and from thence to the summit on their own shoulders while
      they pay a considerable rent for liberty to cultivate a barren, waste, and
      rigid soil. In short, there is not in creation a more laborious animal
      than an Irish peasant, with less stimulus to exertion, or less reward to
      crown his toil. He is indeed, in many instances, the mere creature of the
      soil, and works independent of that hope which is the best stimulus to
      every human effort, the hope of reward. And yet it is not rare to find
      among these oft misguided beings, some who really believe themselves the
      hereditary proprietors of the soil they cultivate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the most ignorant among them must be well aware
      that all could not have been proprietors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;the followers of many a great family
      having accidentally adopted the name of their chiefs, that name has
      descended to their progeny, who now associate to the name an erroneous
      claim on the confiscated property of those to whom their progenitors were
      but vassals or dependants. And this false, but strong rooted opinion,
      co-operating with their naturally active and impetuous characters, renders
      them alive to every enterprise, and open to the impositions of the artful
      or ambitious. But a brave, though misguided people, are not to be
      dragooned out of a train of ancient prejudices, nurtured by fancied
      interest and real ambition, and confirmed by ignorance, which those who
      deride have made no effort to dispel. It is not by physical force, but
      moral influence, the illusion is to be dissolved. The darkness of
      ignorance must be dissipated before the light of truth can be admitted;
      and though an Irishman may be argued out of an error, it has been long
      proved he will never be forced. His understanding may be convinced, but
      his spirit will never be subdued. He may culminate to the meridian of
      loyalty * or truth by the influence of kindness, or the convictions of
      reason, but he will never be forced towards the one, nor oppressed into
      the other by the lash of power, or &lsquo;the insolence of office.&rsquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Speaking of the people of Ireland, Lord Minto thus
     expresses himself: &ldquo;In these (the Irish) we have witnessed
     exertions of courage, activity, perseverance, and spirit, as
     well as fidelity and honour in fulfilling the engagements of
     their connexion with us, and the Protection and defence of
     their own country, which challenges the thanks of Great
     Britain, and the approbation of the world.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has been strongly evinced by the attachment of the Irish to the
      House of Stuart, by whom they have always been so cruelly, so ungratefully
      treated. For what the coercive measures of four hundred years could not
      effect, the accession of <i>one</i> prince to the throne accomplished.
      Until that period, the unconquered Irish, harassing and harassed,
      struggled for that liberty which they at intervals obtained, but never
      were permitted to enjoy. Yet the moment a prince of the royal line of
      Milesius placed the British diadem on his brow, the sword of resistance
      was sheathed, and those principles which force could not vanquish, yielded
      to the mild empire of national and hereditary affection: the Irish of <i>English</i>
      origin from natural tenderness, and those of the <i>true old stock</i>,
      from the conviction that they were <i>then</i> governed by a <i>Prince</i>
      of their own blood. Nor is it now unknown to them, that in the veins of
      his present majesty, and his ancestors, from James the First, flows the
      royal blood of the <i>three</i> kingdoms united.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to find,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the lower ranks of a country, to which
      I am now so endeared, thus rescued from the obloquy thrown on them by
      prejudiced illiberality; and from what you have said, and indeed from what
      I have myself observed, I am convinced, that were endeavours for their
      improvement more strictly promoted, and their respective duties obviously
      made clear, their true interests fully represented by reason and common
      sense, and their unhappy situations ameliorated by justice and humanity,
      they would be a people as happy, contented and prosperous, in a political
      sense, as in a natural and a national one. They are brave, hospitable,
      liberal and ingenious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We now continued to proceed through a country rich in all the boundless
      extravagance of picturesque beauty, where Nature&rsquo;s sublimest features
      everywhere present themselves, carelessly disposed in wild magnificence;
      unimproved, and indeed, almost unimproveable by art. The far-stretched
      ocean, mountains of Alpine magnitude, heaths of boundless desolation,
      vales of romantic loveliness, navigable rivers, and extensive lakes,
      alternately succeeding to each other, while the ruins of an ancient
      castle, or the mouldering remains of a desolated abbey, gave a moral
      interest to the pleasure derived from the contemplation of Nature in her
      happiest and most varied aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not extraordinary,&rdquo; said I, as we loitered over the ruins of an
      abbey, &ldquo;that though your country was so long before the introduction of
      Christianity inhabited by a learned and ingenious people, yet, that among
      your Gothic ruins, no traces of a more ancient and splendid architecture
      are to be discovered. From the ideas I have formed of the primeval
      grandeur of Ireland, I should almost expect to see a Balbec or Palmyra
      arising amidst these stupendous mountains and picturesque scenes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;a country may be civilized, enlightened, and
      even learned and ingenious, without attaining to any considerable
      perfection in those arts, which give to posterity <i>sensible</i>
      memorials of its past splendour. The ancient Irish, like the modern, had
      more <i>soul</i>, more genius than worldly prudence, or cautious,
      calculating forethought. The feats of the hero engrossed them more than
      the exertions of the mechanist; works of imagination seduced them from
      pursuing works of utility. With an enthusiasm bordering on a species of
      mania, they were devoted to poetry and music; and to &lsquo;<i>Wake the soul of
      song</i>&rsquo; was to them an object of more interesting importance, than to
      raise that edifice which would betray to posterity their ancient grandeur
      Besides, at that period to which you allude, the Irish were in that era of
      society, when the iron age was yet distant, and the artist confined his
      skill to the elegant workmanship of gold and brass, which is ascertained
      by the number of warlike implements and beautiful ornaments of dress of
      those metals, exquisitely worked, which are still frequently found in the
      bogs of Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, however, (said I) there are no remnants of a Laurentinum, or Tusculum
      to be discovered, I perceive that at every ten or twelve miles, in the
      fattest of the land, the ruins of an abbey and its granaries are
      discernable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, (returned the priest, laughing) you would not have the good father
      abbots advise the dying, but generous sinner, to leave the worst of his
      lands to God! that would be sacrilege&mdash;but besides the voluntary
      donation of estates from rich penitents, the regular monks of Ireland had
      landed properties attached to their convents. Sometimes they possessed
      immense tracts of a country, from which the officiating clergy seldom or
      never derived any benefit; and, I believe, that many, if not <i>most</i>
      of the bishops&rsquo; leases now existing, are the confiscated revenues of these
      ruined abbeys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, (said I) after all, it is only a transfer of property from one
      opulent ecclesiastic to another; * and the great difference between the
      luxurious abbot of other times, and the rich church dignitary of the
      present, lies in a few speculative theories, which, whether they are or
      are not consonant to reason and common sense, have certainly no connexion
      with <i>true</i> religion or <i>true</i> morality. While the bishopricks
      now, like the abbeys of old, are estimated rather by the profit gained to
      the temporal, than the harvest reaped to the heavenly Lord. However, I
      suppose, they borrow a sanction from the perversion of scriptural
      authority, and quote the Jewish law, not intended for the benefit of <i>individuals</i>
      to the detriment of a whole body, but which extended to the whole tribe of
      Levi, and, doubtlessly, strengthen it by a sentiment of St. Paul: &lsquo;If we
      sow unto you spiritual things, is it not just we reap your carnal?&rsquo; &amp;c.
      It is, however, lucky for your country, that your abbots are not as
      numerous in the present day as formerly.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * For instance, the Abbey of Raphoe was founded by St.
     Columkill, who was succeeded in it by St. Eanon. The first
     Bishop of Raphoe having converted the abbey into a cathedral
     see. It is now a protestant bishoprick.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Numerous, indeed, as you perceive (said the priest) by these ruins; for
      we are told in the Life of St. Ramoloi, that there were a greater number
      of monks and superb monasteries in Ireland than in any other part of
      Europe. St. Co-lumkill and his contemporaries alone erected in this
      kingdom upwards of two hundred abbeys, if their biographers are to be
      credited; and the luxury of their governors kept pace with their power and
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the abbey of Enis, a sanctuary was provided for the cowls of the
      friars and the veils of the nuns, which were costly and beautifully
      wrought. We read that (knights excepted) the prelates only were allowed to
      have gold bridles and harness; and that among the rich presents bestowed
      by Bishop Snell, in 1146, on a cathedral, were gloves, pontificals,
      sandals, and silken robes, interwoven with golden spots, and adorned with
      precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a monument of monkish luxury still remaining among the
      interesting ruins of Sligo abbey. This noble edifice stands in the midst
      of a rich and beautiful scenery, on the banks of a river, near which is a
      spot still shown, where, as tradition runs, a box or weir was placed, in
      which the fish casually entered, and which contained a spring, that
      communicated by a cord with a bell hung in the refectory. The weight of
      the fish pressed down the spring; the cord vibrated; the bell rung; and
      the unfortunate captive thus taken suffered martyrdom, by being placed on
      a fire alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was served up,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I suppose on a fast day, to the <i>abstemious</i>
      monks, who would, however, have looked upon a morsel of flesh meat thrown
      in this way, as a lure to eternal perdition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already weary of a conversation in which my heart took little interest, I
      now suffered it to die away; and while Father John began a parley with a
      traveller who socially joined us, I gave up my whole soul to love and to
      Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the evening we arrived at the house of our destined host.
      Although it was late, the family had not yet gone to dinner, as the
      servant who took our horses informed us, that his master had but that
      moment returned from a fair. We had scarcely reached the hall, when, the
      report of our arrival having preceded our appearance, the whole family
      rushed out to receive us. What a group!&mdash;the father looked like the
      very Genius of Hospitality, the mother like the personified spirit of a
      cordial welcome; three laughing Hebe daughters; two fine young fellows
      supporting an aged grandsire, a very Silenus in appearance, and a pretty
      demure little governess, with a smile and a hand as ready as the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, according to the good old Irish fashion, saluted the cheeks of
      the ladies, and had his hands nearly shaken off by the men; while I was
      received with all the cordiality that could be lavished on a friend, and
      all the politeness that could be paid to a stranger. A welcome shone in
      every eye; ten thousand welcomes echoed from every lip; and the arrival of
      the unexpected guests seemed a festival of the social feelings to the
      whole warm-hearted family. If this is a true specimen of the first rites
      of hospitality, among the <i>independent country gentlemen of Ireland</i>,
      * it is to me the most captivating of all possible ceremonies.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * To those who have witnessed [as I so often have] the
     celebration of these endearing rites, this picture will
     appear but a very cold and languid sketch.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the first interchange of our courtesies had passed on both sides, we
      were conducted to the refreshing comforts of a dressing-room; but the
      domestics were not suffered to interfere, all were in fact our servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plenteous dinner was composed of every luxury the season afforded;
      though only supplied by the demesne of our host and the neighbouring
      sea-coast, and though served up in a style of perfect elegance, was yet so
      abundant, so over plenteous, that, compared to the compact neatness, and
      simple sufficiency of English fare in the same rank of life, it might have
      been thought to have been &ldquo;more than hospitably good.&rdquo; But to my surprise,
      and indeed, not much to my satisfaction, during dinner the door was left
      open for the benefit of receiving the combined efforts of a very
      indifferent fiddler and a tolerable piper, who, however, seemed to hold
      the life and spirits of the family in their keeping. The ladies left us
      early after the cloth was removed; and though besides the family there
      were three strange gentlemen, and that the table was covered with
      excellent wines, yet conversation circulated with much more freedom than
      the bottle; every one did as he pleased, and the ease of the guest seemed
      the pleasure of the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I rose in less than an hour after the retreat of the ladies,
      and followed them to the drawing-room. I found them all employed; one at
      the piano, another at her needle-work, a third reading; mamma at her
      knitting, and the pretty little duenna copying out music.
    </p>
    <p>
      They received me as an old acquaintance, and complimented me on my
      temperance in so soon retiring from the gentlemen, for which I assured
      them they had all the credit. It is certain that the frank and open
      ingenuousness of an Irishwoman&rsquo;s manners, forms a strong contrast to that
      placid, but distant reserve which characterises the address of my own
      charming countrywomen. For my part, since I have Glorvina, I shall never
      again endure that perpetuity of air, look, and address, which those who
      mistake formality for good-breeding are apt to assume. Manners, like the
      graduated scale of the thermometer, should betray, by degrees, the
      expansion or contraction of the feeling, as they are warmed by emotion or
      chilled by indifference. They should <i>breathe</i> the soul in order to
      <i>win</i> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more animated yet more modest than the manners of these
      charming girls, nor should I require any stronger proof of that pure and
      exquisite chastity of character which, from the earliest period, has
      distinguished the women of this country, than that ingenuous candour and
      enchanting frankness which accompanies their every look and word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The soul as sure to be admired as seen,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Boldly steps forth, nor keeps a thought within.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although the Miss O&rsquo;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s are very charming
      girls, although their mother seems a very rational and amiable being, and
      although their governess appears to be a young woman of distinguished
      education and considerable talent; yet I in vain sought in their
      conversation for that soul-seizing charm which, with a magic, undefinable
      influence breathes round the syren <i>Princess of Inismore</i>. O! it was
      requisite I should mingle, converse with other women to justly appreciate
      all I possess in the society of Glorvina; for surely she is <i>more</i>,
      or every other woman is <i>less</i> than mortal!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the men joined us in the drawing-room, I was quite <i>boudoirized</i>
      with these unaffected and pleasing girls. One wound her working-silk off
      my hands, another would try my skill at battledore, and the youngest, a
      charming little being of thirteen, told me the history of a pet dove that
      was dying in her lap; while all in-treated I would talk to them of the
      Princess of Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said the youngest girl, &ldquo;I always think of her as of the
      &lsquo;Sleeping Beauty in the Wood,&rsquo; or some other princess in a fairy tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know nothing of her, however,&rdquo; said
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O&rsquo;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-, &ldquo;but by report; we live at too
      great a distance to keep up any connexion with the Inismore family;
      besides, that it is generally understood to be Mr. O&rsquo;Melville&rsquo;s wish to
      live in retirement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is the first time I ever heard my soi-disant Prince mentioned without
      his title; but I am sure I should never endure to hear my Glorvina called
      Miss O&rsquo;Melville. For to me, too, does she appear more like the Roganda of
      a fairy tale, than &ldquo;any mortal mixture of earth&rsquo;s mould.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen now joined us, and as soon as tea was over, the piper struck
      up in the hall, and in a moment every one was on their feet. My long
      journey was received as a sufficient plea for my being a spectator only;
      but the priest refused the immunity, and led out the lady mother; the rest
      followed, and the idol amusement of the gay-hearted Irish, received its
      usual homage. But though the women danced with considerable grace and
      spirit, they did not, like Glorvina,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Send the soul upon a jig to heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The dance was succeeded by a good supper; the supper by a cheerful song,
      and every one seemed unwilling to be the first to break up a social
      compact over which the spirit of harmony presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the priest and I retired to our rooms, &ldquo;You have now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;had a
      specimen of the mode of living of the Irish gentry of a certain rank in
      this country; the day is devoted to agricultural business, the evening to
      temperate festivity and innocent amusement; but neither the avocations of
      the morning nor the engagements of the evening suspend the rites of
      hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far I wrote before I retired that night to rest, and the next morning
      at an early hour we took our leave of these courteous and hospitable
      Milesians; having faithfully promised on the preceding night to repeat our
      visit on our return from the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now at a sorry little inn, within a mile or two of the nobleman&rsquo;s
      seat to whom the priest is come, and on whom he waits to-morrow, having
      just learned that his lordship passed by here to-day on his way to a
      gentleman&rsquo;s house in the neighbourhood where he dines. The little postboy
      at this moment rides up to the door; I shall drop this in his bag, and
      begin a new journal on a fresh sheet.

    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he priest is gone
      on his embassy. The rain which batters against the casement of my little
      hotel prevents me enjoying a ramble. I have nothing to read, and I must
      write or yawn myself to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, as we passed the imaginary line which divides the province of
      Connaught from that of Ulster, the priest said, &ldquo;As we now advance
      northward, we shall gradually lose sight of the genuine Irish character,
      and those ancient manners, modes, customs, and language with which it is
      inseparably connected. Not long after the chiefs of Ireland had declared
      James the First universal monarch of their country, a sham plot was
      pretended, consonant to the usual ingratitude of the House of Stuart, by
      which six entire counties of the north became forfeited, which James with
      a liberal hand bestowed on his favorites; * so that this part of Ireland
      may in some respects be considered as a Scottish colony; and in fact,
      Scotch dialect, Scotch manners, Scotch modes, and the Scotch character
      almost universally prevail. Here the ardour of the Irish constitution
      seems abated if not chilled. Here the <i>ceadmile falta</i> of Irish
      cordiality seldom lends its welcome home to a stranger&rsquo;s heart. The bright
      beams which illumine the gay images of Milesian fancy are extinguished;
      the convivial pleasures, dear to the Milesian heart, scared at the
      prudential maxims of calculating interest, take flight to the warmer
      regions of the south; and the endearing socialities of the soul, lost and
      neglected amidst the cold concerns of the counting-house and the <i>bleach-green</i>,
      droop and expire in the deficiency of the nutritive warmth on which their
      tender existence depends.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;The pretext of rebellion was devised as a specious
     prelude to predetermined confiscations, and the inhabitants
     of six counties, whose aversion to the yoke of England the
     show of lenity might have disarmed, were compelled to
     encounter misery in deserts, and, what is perhaps still mote
     mortifying to human pride, to behold the patrimony of their
     ancestors, which force had wrested from their hands,
     bestowed the prey of a more favoured people. The substantial
     view of providing for his indigent countrymen might have
     gratified the national partiality of James; the favourite
     passion of the English was gratified by the triumph of
     Protestantism, and the downfall of its antagonists: men who
     professed to correct a system of peace did not hesitate to
     pursue their purpose through a scene of iniquity which
     humanity shudders to relate; and by an action more criminal,
     because more deliberate, than the massacre of St.
     Bartholomew, two-thirds of an extensive province were
     offered up in one great hecatomb, on the altar of false
     policy and theological prejudice. Here let us survey with
     wonder the mysterious operations of divine wisdom, which,
     from a measure base in its means, and atrocious in its
     execution, has derived a source of fame, freedom, and
     industry to Ireland.&rdquo;&mdash;Vide a Review of some interesting
     periods of Irish History.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the shades of the picture, which, however, possesses its
      lights, and those of no dim lustre. The north of Ireland may be justly
      esteemed the palladium of Irish industry and Irish trade, where the staple
      commodity of the kingdom is reared and manufactured; and while the rest of
      Ireland is devoted to that species of agriculture, which, in lessening the
      necessity of human labour, deprives man of subsistence; while the wretched
      native of the southern provinces (where little labour is required, and
      consequently little hire given) either famishes in the midst of a helpless
      family, or begs his way to England, and offers those services <i>there</i>
      in harvest time, which his own country rejects. Here, both the labourer
      and his hire rise in the scale of political consideration; here more hands
      are called for than can be procured; and the peasant, stimulated to
      exertions by the reward it reaps for him, enjoys the fruits of his
      industry, and acquires a relish for the comforts and conveniences of life.
      Industry, and this taste for comparative luxury, mutually react; and the
      former, while it bestows the <i>means</i>, enables them to gratify the
      suggestions of the latter; while their wants, nurtured by enjoyment,
      afford fresh allurement to continued exertion, In short, a mind not too
      deeply fascinated by the florid virtues, the warm overflowings of generous
      and ardent qualities, will find in the northerns of this island much to
      admire and more to esteem; but on the heart they make little claims, and
      from its affections they receive but little tribute.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Belfast cannot be deemed the metropolis of Ulster, but may
     almost be said to be the Athens of Ireland. It is at least
     the cynosure of the province in which it stands; and those
     beams of genius which are there concentrated, send to the
     extremest point of the hemisphere in which they shine no
     faint ray of lumination.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in the name of all that is warm and cordial,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us
      hasten back to the province of Connaught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may be sure we shall,&rdquo; returned Father John: &ldquo;for I know none of
      these sons of trade; and until we once more find ourselves within the pale
      of Milesian hospitality, we must put up at a sorry inn, near a tract of
      the sea-coast, called the Magilligans, and where one <i>solitary fane</i>
      is raised to the once tutelar deity of Ireland; in plain English, where
      one of the last of the race of <i>Irish bards</i> shelters his white head
      beneath the fractured roof of a wretched hut. Although the evening sun was
      setting on the western wave when we reached the auberge, yet, while our
      fried eggs and bacon were preparing, I proposed to the priest that we
      should visit the old bard before we put up our horses. Father John readily
      consented, and we enquired his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the <i>mon wi the twa heads?</i>&rdquo; said our host. I confessed my
      ignorance of this hydra epithet, which I learned was derived from an
      immense wen on the back of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; continued our host, &ldquo;A wull be telling you weel to gang tull the
      auld Kearn, and one o&rsquo; our wains wull show ye the road. Ye need nae fear
      trusting yoursels to our wee Wully, for he is an uncommon canie chiel.&rdquo;
       Such was the dialect of this Hibernian Scot, who assured me he had never
      been twenty miles from his &ldquo;aine wee hame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We, however, dispensed with the guidance of <i>wee Wully</i>, and easily
      found our way to the hut of the man &ldquo;<i>wi the twa heads</i>.&rdquo; It stood on
      the right hand by the road side. We entered it without ceremony, and as it
      is usual for strangers to visit this last of the &ldquo;Sons of Song,&rdquo; his
      family betrayed no signs of surprise at our appearance. His ancient dame
      announced us to her husband When we entered he was in bed; and when he
      arose to receive us (for he was dressed, and appeared only to have lain
      down from debility,) we perceived that his harp had been the companion of
      his repose, and was actually laid under the bed-clothes with him. We found
      the venerable bard cheerful * and communicative, and he seemed to enter
      even with an eager readiness on the circumstances of his past life, while
      his &ldquo;soul seemed heightened by the song,&rdquo; with which at intervals he
      interrupted his narrative. How strongly did those exquisitely beautiful
      lines of Ossian rush on my recollection: &ldquo;But age is now on my tongue, and
      my mind has failed me; the sons of song are gone to rest; my voice remains
      like a blast that roars loudly on a sea-surrounded rock after the winds
      are laid, and the distant mariner sees the waving trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So great was my veneration for this &ldquo;Bard of other times,&rdquo; that I felt as
      though it would have been an indelicacy to have offered him any pecuniary
      reward for the exertions of his tuneful talent; I therefore made my little
      offering to his wife, having previously, while he was reciting his
      &ldquo;unvarnished tale,&rdquo; taken a sketch of his most singularly interesting and
      striking figure, as a present for Glorvina on my return to Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      While my heart a thousand times called on hers to participate in the sweet
      but melancholy pleasure it experienced, as I listened to and gazed on this
      venerable being.

     The following account of the Bard of the Magilligans was
     taken from his own lips, July 3, 1805, by the Rev. Mr.
     Sampson, of Magilligan, and forwarded to the author,
     (through the medium of Dr. Patterson of Derry,) previous to
     her visit to that part of the north, which took place a few
     weeks after.

     Umbro, July 3, 1805.

     Magilligan.

     &ldquo;I made the survey of the &lsquo;man with the two heads,&rsquo;
     according to your desire; but not till yesterday, on
     account of various <i>impossibilities</i>.

     &ldquo;Here is my report.&mdash;

     &ldquo;Dennis Hampson, or the &lsquo;man with the two heads,&rsquo; is a
     native of Craigmore, near Garvah, county Derry; his father,
     Brian Dorrogher Hampson, held the whole town-land of
     Tyrcrevan; his mother&rsquo;s relations were in possession of the
     Wood-town (both considerable farms in Magilligan.) He lost
     his sight at the age of three years by the smallpox; at
     twelve years he began to learn the harp under Bridget
     O&rsquo;Cahan: &lsquo;For,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;in those times, <i>women</i> as well
     as men were taught the Irish harp in the best families; and
     every old Irish family had harps in plenty.&rsquo;

     &ldquo;His next master was John C. Gairagher, a blind travelling
     harper, whom he followed to Buncranagh, where his master
     used to play for Colonel Vaughan; he had afterwards
     Laughlan Hanning and Patrick Connor in succession as
     masters.

     &ldquo;&lsquo;All these were from Connaught, which was,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;the
     best part of the kingdom for Irish music and for harpers.&rsquo;
     At eighteen years of age he began to play for himself, and
     was taken into the house of Counseller Canning, at Garvah,
     for half a year; his host, with Squire Gage and Doctor
     Bacon, bought him a harp. He travelled nine or ten years
     through Ireland and Scotland, and tells facetious stories of
     gentlemen in both countries: among others, that in passing
     near the place of Sir J. Campbell, at Aghanbrack, he learn-
     ed that this gentleman had spent a great deal, and was
     living on so much per week of allowance. Hampson through
     delicacy would not call, but some of the domestics were sent
     after him; on coming into the castle, Sir J. asked him why
     he had not called, adding, &lsquo;Sir, there was never a harper
     but yourself that passed the door of my father&rsquo;s house to
     which Hampson answered that &lsquo;he had heard in the
     <i>nighbourhood</i> that his honor was not often at home.&rsquo; with
     which delicate evasion Sir J. was satisfied. He adds, &lsquo;that
     this was the highest bred and stateliest man he ever knew;
     if he were putting on a new pair of gloves, and one of them
     dropped on the floor, (though ever so clean) he would order
     the servant to bring him another pair.&rsquo; He says that in that
     time he never met with but one laird that had a harp, and
     that was a very small one, played on formerly by the laird&rsquo;s
     father; that when he had tuned it with new strings, the
     laird and his lady both were so pleased with his music that
     they invited him back in these words: &lsquo;Hampson, as soon as
     you think this child of ours (a boy of three years of age)
     is fit to learn on his grandfather&rsquo;s harp, come back to
     teach him, and you shall not repent it:&rsquo;&mdash;but this he never
     accomplished.

     &ldquo;He told me a story of the laird of Strone with a great deal
     of comic relish. When he was playing at the house, a message
     came that a large party of gentlemen were coming to grouse,
     and would spend some days with <i>him</i> (the laird;) the lady
     being in great distress turned to her husband, saying &lsquo;what
     shall we do, my dear, for so many in the way of beds?&rsquo; &lsquo;Give
     yourself no vexation,&rsquo; replied the laird, &lsquo;give us enough to
     eat, and I will supply the rest; and as to beds, believe
     me, <i>every man shall find one for himself</i>;&rsquo; (meaning that
     his guests would fall under the table.) In his second trip
     to Scotland, in the year 1745, being at Edinburgh when
     <i>Charley</i> the Pretender, was there, he was called into the
     great hall to play; at first he was alone, afterwards four
     fiddlers joined: the tune called for was, &lsquo;The king shall
     enjoy his own again;&rsquo;&mdash;he sung here part of the words
     following:&mdash;=
</pre>
    <p class="indent30">
      &lsquo;I hope to see the day
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When the whigs shall run away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the king shall enjoy his own again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I asked him if he heard the Pretender speak; he replied&mdash;
     &lsquo;I only heard him ask, Is Sylvan there? on which some one
     answered, he is not here, please your royal highness, but he
     shall be sent for.&rsquo;  &lsquo;He meant to say <i>Sullivan</i>,&rsquo; continued
     Hampson, &lsquo;but that was the way he called the name.&rsquo; He says
     that Captain Mac Donnell, when in Ireland, came to see him,
     and that he told the captain that Charley&rsquo;s cockade was in
     his father&rsquo;s house.

     &ldquo;Hampson was brought into the Pretender&rsquo;s presence by
     Colonel Kelly, of Roscommon, and Sir Thomas Sheridan, and
     that he, (Hampson) was then about fifty years old. He played
     in many Irish houses, among others, those of Lord de
     Courcey, Mr. Fortesque, Sir P. Belew, Squire Roche, and in
     the great towns, Dublin, Cork, &amp;c., &amp;c. Respecting all which
     he interspersed pleasant anecdotes with surprising gaiety
     and correctness; he mentioned many anecdotes of my
     grandfather and grand-aunt, at whose houses he used to be
     frequently. In fact, in this identical harper, whom you sent
     me to <i>survey</i>, I recognized an acquaintance, who, as soon
     as he found me out, seemed exhilarated at having an old
     friend of (what he called) &lsquo;the old stock,&rsquo; in his poor
     cabin. He even mentioned many anecdotes of my own boyhood,
     which, though by me long forgotten, were accurately true.
     These things show the surprising power of his recollection
     at the age of one hundred and eight years. Since I saw him
     last, which was in 1787, the wen on the back of his head is
     greatly increased; it is now hanging over his neck and
     shoulders, nearly as large as his head, from which
     circumstance he derives his appellative, &lsquo;the man with two
     heads.&rsquo; General Hart, who is an admirer of music, sent a
     limner lately to take a drawing of him, which cannot fail to
     be interesting, if it were only for the venerable expression
     of his meagre, blind countenance, and the symmetry of his
     tall, thin, but not debilitated person. I found him lying on
     his back in bed near the fire of his cabin; his family
     employed in the usual way; his harp under the bed-clothes,
     by which his face was covered also. When he heard my name he
     started up (being already dressed) and seemed rejoiced to
     hear the sound of my voice, which, he said, he began to
     recollect. He asked for my children, whom I brought to see
     him, and he felt them over and over;&mdash;then, with tones of
     great affection, he blessed <i>God</i> that he had <i>seen</i> four
     generations of the name, and ended by giving the children
     his blessing. He then tuned his old time-beaten harp, his
     solace and bed-fellow, and played with astonishing justness
     and good taste.

     &ldquo;The tunes which he played were his favourites; and he,
     with an elegance of manner, said at the same time, &lsquo;I
     remember you have a fondness for music, and the tunes you
     used to ask for I have not forgotten, which were Cualin, The
     Dawning of the Day, Elleen-a-roon, Ceandubhdilis, &amp;c.

     These, except the third, were the first tunes, which,
     according to regulation, he played at the famous meeting of
     harpers at Belfast, under the patronage of some amateurs of
     Irish music. Mr. Bunton, the celebrated musician of that
     town, was here the year before, at Hampson&rsquo;s, noting his
     tunes and his manner of playing, which is in the best old
     style. He said with the hottest feeling of self-love, &lsquo;When
     I played the old tunes not another of the harpers would play
     after me.&rsquo; He came to Magilligan many years ago, and at the
     age of eighty-six, married a woman of Innishowen, whom he
     found living in the house of a friend. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rsquo; quoth
     Hampson, &lsquo;if it was not the devil buckled us together; she
     being lame and I blind.&rsquo; By this wife he has one daughter,
     married to a cooper, who has several children, and maintains
     them all, though Hampson (in this alone seeming to doat)
     says that his son-in-law is a spendthrift and that he
     maintains them; the family humour his whim, and the old man
     is quieted. He is pleased when they tell him, as he thinks
     is the case, that several people of character, for musical
     taste, send letters to invite him; and he, though incapable
     now of leaving the house, is planning expeditions never to
     be attempted, much less realized; these are the only traces
     of mental debility; as to his body, he has no inconvenience
     but that arising from a chronic disorder: his habits have
     ever been sober; his favourite drink, once beer, now milk
     and water; his diet chiefly potatoes. I asked him to teach
     my daughter, but he declined: adding, however, that it was
     too hard for a young girl, but that nothing would give him
     greater pleasure if he thought it could be done.

     &ldquo;Lord Bristol, while lodging at the bathing house of Mount
     Salut, near Magilligan, gave three guineas and ground rent
     free, to build the house where Hampson now lives. At the
     house-warming, his lordship with his lady and family came,
     and the children danced to his harp; the bishop gave three
     crowns to the family, and in the <i>dear</i> year, his lordship
     called in his coach and six, stopped at the door, and gave a
     guinea to buy meal.

     &ldquo;Would it not be well to get up a subscription for poor old
     Hampson? It might be sent to various towns where he is
     known.

     &ldquo;Ever yours,

     &ldquo;C. V. SAMPSON.&rdquo;

     In February, 1806, the author, being then but eighteen miles
     distant from the residence of the bard, received a message
     from him, intimating that as he heard she wished to purchase
     his harp, he would dispose of it on very moderate terms. He
     was then in good health and spirits though in his hundred
     and ninth year.

      Whenever there was a revel of the feelings, a joy of the imagination, or a
      delicate fruition of a refined and touching sentiment, how my soul misses
      her! I find it impossible to make even the amiable and intelligent priest
      enter into the nature of my feelings; but how naturally, in the
      overflowing of my heart, do I turn towards her, yet turn in vain, or find
      her image only in my enamoured soul, which is full of her. Oh! how much do
      I owe her. What a vigorous spring has she opened in the wintry waste of a
      desolated mind. It seems as though a seal had been fixed upon every bliss
      of the senses and the heart, which her breath alone could dissolve; that
      all was gloom and chaos until she said &ldquo;let there be light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we rode back to our auberge by the light of a cloudless but declining
      moon, after some conversation on the subject of the bard whom we had
      visited, the priest exclaimed, &ldquo;Who would suppose that that wretched hut
      was the residence of one of that order once so revered among the Irish;
      whose persons and properties were held sacred and inviolable by the common
      consent of all parties, as well as by the laws of the nation, even in all
      the vicissitudes of warfare, and all the anarchy of intestine commotion;
      an order which held the second rank in the state; and whose members, in
      addition to the interesting duties of their profession, were the heralds
      of peace, and the donors of immortality? Clothed in white and flowing
      robes, the bards marched to battle at the head of the troops, and by the
      side of the chief; and while by their martial strains they awakened
      courage even to desperation in the heart of the warrior, borne away by the
      furor of their own enthusiasm, they not unfrequently rushed into the thick
      of the fight themselves, and by their maddening inspirations decided the
      fate of the battle; or when victory descended on the ensanguined plain,
      they hung over the warrior&rsquo;s funeral pile, and chaunted to the strains of
      the national lyre the deeds of the valiant, and the prowess of the hero;
      while the brave and listening survivors envied and emulated the glory of
      the deceased, and believed that this tribute of inspired genius at the
      funeral rites was necessary to the repose of the departed soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The genuine history and records of Ireland abound with
     incidents singularly romantic, and of details exquisitely
     interesting. In the account of the death of the celebrated
     hero Conrigh, as given by Demetrius O&rsquo;Connor, the following
     instance of fidelity and affection of a family bard is
     given. &ldquo;When the beautiful but faithless Blanaid, whose hand
     Conrigh had obtained as the reward of his valour, armed a
     favourite lover against the life of her husband, and fled
     with the murderer; Fierchiertne, the poet and bard of
     Conrigh, in the anguish of his heart for the loss of a
     generous master, resolved upon sacrificing the criminal
     Blanaid to the manes of his murdered lord. He therefore
     secretly pursued her from the palace in Kerry to the court
     of Ulster, whither she had fled with her homicide paramour.
     On his arrival there, the first object that saluted his eyes
     was the king of that province, walking on the the edge of
     the steep rocks of Rinchin Beara, surrounded by the
     principal nobility of his court; and in the splendid train
     he soon perceived the lovely, but guilty Blanaid and her
     treacherous lover. The bard concealed himself until he
     observed his mistress withdraw from the brilliant crowd, and
     stand at the edge of a steep cliff; then courteously and
     flatteringly addressing her, and clasping her firmly to his
     breast, threw himself headlong with his prey down the
     precipice. They were both dashed to pieces.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from what period,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;may the decline of these once potent and
      revered members of the state be dated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would almost venture to say,&rdquo; returned the priest, &ldquo;so early as in the
      latter end of the sixth century; for we read in an Irish record, that
      about <i>that</i> period the <i>Irish monarch</i> convened the princes,
      nobles, and clergy of the kingdom, to the parliament of <i>Drumceat</i>;
      and the chief motive alleged for summoning this vast assembly was to
      banish the Fileas or bards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which might be deemed then,&rdquo; interrupted I, &ldquo;a league of the <i>Dunces</i>
      against <i>Wit</i> and <i>Genius</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether,&rdquo; returned the priest. &ldquo;It was in some respects a
      necessary policy. For, strange to say, nearly the third part of Ireland
      had adopted a profession at once so revered, and privileged, so honoured
      and so caressed by all ranks of the state. Indeed, about this period, such
      was the influence they had obtained in the kingdom, that the inhabitants
      without distinction were obliged to receive and maintain them from
      November till May, if it were the pleasure of the bard to become their
      guest; nor were there any object on which their daring wishes rested that
      was not instantly put into their possession. And such was the ambition of
      one of their order, that he made a demand on the golden broach or clasp
      that braced the regal robe on the breast of royalty itself, which was
      unalienable with the crown, and descended with the empire from generation
      to generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what an idea does this give of the omnipotence of
      music and poetry among those refined enthusiasts, who have ever borne with
      such impatience the oppressive chain of power, yet suffer themselves to be
      soothed into slavery by the melting strains of the national lyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; replied the priest, &ldquo;that no nation, not even the Greeks,
      were ever attached with more passionate enthusiasm to the divine arts of
      poesy and song, than the ancient Irish, until their fatal and boundless
      indulgence to their professors became a source of inquietude and
      oppression to the whole state. The celebrated St. Columkill, who was
      himself a poet, became a mediator between the monarch, already mentioned
      and the &lsquo;<i>tuneful throng</i>;&rsquo; and by his intercession, the king changed
      his first intention of banishing the whole college of bards, to limiting
      their numbers; for it was an argument of the liberal saint that it became
      a great monarch to patronize the arts; to retain about his person an
      eminent bard and antiquary; and to allow to his tributary princes or
      chieftains, a poet capable of singing their exploits, and of registering
      the genealogy of their illustrious families. This liberal and necessary
      plan of reformation, suggested by the saint, was adopted by the monarch;
      and these salutary regulations became the prominent standard for many
      succeeding ages: and though the severity of those regulations against the
      bards, enforced in the tyrannic reign of Henry VIII, as proposed by Baron
      Finglas, considerably lessened their power; * yet until the reign of
      Elizabeth their characters were not stripped of that sacred <i>stole</i>,
      which the reverential love of their countrymen had flung over them. The
      high estimation in which the bard was held in the commencement of the
      empire of Ireland&rsquo;s archenemy is thus attested by Sir Philip Sidney:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  Item.&mdash;That no Irish minstrels, rhymers, thanaghs
     nebards, be messengers to desire any goods of any man
     dwelling within the English pale, upon pain of forfeiture of
     all their goods, and their bodies to be imprisoned at the
     king&rsquo;s will.&mdash;Harris&rsquo;s Hibernica, p. 98.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In our neighbouring country,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;where truly learning grows very
      bare, yet are their poets held in devout reverence.&rsquo; But Elizabeth,
      jealous of that influence which the bardic order of Ireland held over the
      most puissant of her chiefs, not only enacted laws against them, but
      against such as received or entertained them: for Spenser informs us that,
      even <i>then</i>, &lsquo;their verses were taken up with a general applause, and
      usually sung at all feasts and meetings.&rsquo; Of the spirited, yet pathetic
      manner in which the genius of Irish minstrelsy addressed itself to the
      soul of the Irish chief, many instances are still preserved in the records
      of traditional lore. A poem of Fearflatha, family bard to the O&rsquo;Nials of
      Clanboy, and beginning thus:&mdash;&lsquo;O the condition of our dear
      countrymen, how languid their joys, how acute their sorrows, &amp;c.,
      &amp;c.,&rsquo; the Prince of Inismore takes peculiar delight in repeating. But
      in the lapse of time, and vicissitude of revolution, this order, once so
      revered, has finally sunk into the casual retention of a harper, piper, or
      fiddler, which are generally, but not universally to be found in the
      houses of the Irish country gentlemen; as you have yourself witnessed in
      the castle of Inismore and the hospitable mansion of the O&rsquo;D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s.
      One circumstance, however, I must mention to you. Although Ulster was
      never deemed poetic ground, yet when destruction threatened the bardic
      order in the southern and western provinces, where their insolence,
      nurtured by false indulgence, often rendered them an object of popular
      antipathy, hither they fled for protection, and at different periods found
      it from the northern princes: and Ulster, you perceive, is now the last
      resort of the most ancient of the survivors of the ancient Irish bards,
      who, after having imbibed inspiration in the classic regions of Connaught,
      and effused his national strains through every province of his country,
      draws forth the last feeble tones of his almost silenced harp amidst the
      chilling regions of the north; almost unknown and undistinguished, except
      by the few strangers who are led by chance or curiosity to this hut, and
      from whose casual bounties he chiefly derives his subsistence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had now reached the door of our auberge; and the dog of the house
      jumping on me as I alighted, our hostess exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah sir! our wee
      doggie kens ye uncoo weel&rdquo; Is not this the language of the Isle of Sky?
      The priest left me early this morning on his evidently unpleasant embassy.
      On his return we visit the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, which I understand is but
      sixteen miles distant. Of this pilgrimage to the shrine of Nature in her
      grandest aspect, I shall tell you nothing; but when we meet will put into
      your hands a work written on the subject, from which you will derive equal
      pleasure and instruction. At this moment the excellent priest appears on
      his little nag; the rain no longer beats against my casement; the large
      drops suspended from the foliage of the trees sparkle with the beams of
      the meridian sun, which bursting forth in cloudless radiancy, dispels the
      misty shower, and brilliantly lights up the arch of heaven&rsquo;s promise.
      Would you know the images now most buoyant in my cheered bosom; they are
      Ossian and Glorvina: it is for <i>him</i> to describe, for <i>her</i> to
      feel the renovating charms of this interesting moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu! I shall grant you a reprieve till we once more reach the dear ruins
      of Inismore.

      LETTER XXVIII.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      TO J. D. ESQ., M. P.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>lato compares the
      soul to a small republic, of which the reasoning and judging powers are
      stationed in the head as in a citadel, and of which the senses are the
      guards or servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! my dear friend, this republic is with me all anarchy and confusion,
      and its guards, disordered and overwhelmed, can no longer afford it
      protection. I would be calm, and give a succinct account of my return to
      Inismore; but impetuous feelings rush over the recollection of trivial
      circumstances, and all concentrate on that fatal point which transfixes
      every thought, every motion of my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffice it to say, that our second reception at the mansion of the O&rsquo;D&rsquo;s
      had lost nothing of that cordiality which distinguished our first; but
      neither the cheerful kindness of the parents, nor the blandishments of the
      charming daughters could allay that burning impatience which fired my
      bosom to return to Glorvina, after the tedious absence of five long days.
      All night I tossed on my pillow in the restless agitation of expected
      bliss, and with the dawn of that day on which I hoped once more to taste &ldquo;<i>the
      life of life</i>,&rdquo; I arose and flew to the priests room to chide his
      tardiness. Early as it was I found he had already left his apartment, and
      as I turned from the door to seek him, I perceived a written paper lying
      on the floor. I took it up, and, carelessly glancing my eye over it,
      discovered that it was a receipt from the Prince&rsquo;s inexorable creditor,
      who (as Father John informed me) refused to take the farm off his hands:
      but what was my amazement to find that this receipt was an acknowledgment
      for those jewels which I had so often seen stealing their lustre from
      Glorvina&rsquo;s charms; and which were now individually mentioned, and given in
      lieu of the rent for this very farm, by which the Prince was so materially
      injured. The blood boiled in my veins, I could have annihilated this
      rascally cold-hearted landlord; I could have wept on the neck of the
      unfortunate Prince; I could have fallen at the feet of Glor-vina and
      worshipped her as the first of the Almighty&rsquo;s works. Never in the midst of
      all my artificial wants, my boundless and craving extravagance, did I ever
      feel the want of riches as at this moment, when a small part of what I had
      so worthlessly flung away, would have saved the pride of a noble, an
      indignant spirit from a deep and deadly wound and spared the heart of
      filial solicitude and tender sensibility, many a pang or tortured
      feelings. The rent of the farm was a hundred pounds per annum. The Prince,
      I understood, was three years in arrear; yet, though there were no
      diamonds, and not many pearls, I should suppose the jewels were worth more
      than the sum for which they were given. *
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood burning with indignation, the paper still trembling in my
      hand, I heard the footstep of the priest; I let fall the paper; he
      advanced, snatched it up, and put it in his pocket-book, with an air of
      self-reprehension that determined me to conceal the knowledge so
      accidentally acquired. Having left our adieux for our courteous hosts with
      one of the young men, we at last set out for Inismore. The idea of so soon
      meeting my soul&rsquo;s precious Glorvina, banished every idea less delightful.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I have been informed that a descendant of the provincial
     kings of Connaught parted not many years back with his
     golden crown which for so many ages encircled the royal
     brows of his ancestors.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our meeting (said I) will be attended with a new and touching interest,
      the sweet result of that <i>perfect</i> intelligence which now for the
      first time subsisted between us, and which stole its birth from that
      tender and delicious glance which love first bestowed on me beneath the
      cypress tree of the rustic cemetery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already I beheld the &ldquo;air-lifted&rdquo; figure of Glorvina floating towards me.
      Already I felt the soft hands tremble in mine, and gazed on the deep
      suffusion of her kindling blushes, the ardent welcome of her bashful eyes,
      and all that dissolving and impassioned langour, with which she would
      resign herself to the sweet abandonment of her soul&rsquo;s chastened
      tenderness, and the fullest confidence in that adoring heart which had now
      unequivocally assured her of its homage and eternal fealty. In short, I
      had resolved to confess my name and rank to Glorvina, to offer her my
      hand, and to trust to the affection of our fond and indulgent fathers for
      forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus warmed by the visions of my heated fan cy I could no longer stifle my
      impatience; and when we were within seven miles of the castle I told the
      priest, who was ambling slowly on, that I would be his <i>avant-courier</i>,
      and clapping spurs to my horse soon lost sight of my tardy companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the draw-bridge I met one of the servants to whom I gave the panting
      animal, and flew, rather than walked, to the castle. At its portals stood
      the old nurse; she almost embraced me, and I almost returned the caress;
      but with a sorrowful countenance she informed me that the Prince was
      dangerously ill, and had not left his bed since our departure; <i>that
      things altogether were going on but poorly</i>; and that she was sure <i>the
      sight</i> of me would do her young lady&rsquo;s heart good, for that she did
      nothing but weep all day, and sit by her father&rsquo;s bed all night. She then
      informed me that Glorvina was alone in the boudoir. With a thousand pulses
      fluttering at my breast, full of the idea of stealing on the melancholy
      solitude of my pensive love, with a beating heart and noiseless step, I
      approached the sacred asylum of innocence. The door lay partly open;
      Glorvina was seated at a table, and apparently engaged in writing a
      letter, I paused a moment for breath ere I advanced. Glorvina at the same
      instant raised her head from the paper, read over what she had written,
      and wept bitterly; then wrote again&mdash;paused, sighed, and drew a
      letter from her bosom&mdash;(yes, her bosom) which she perused, often
      waving her head, and sighing deeply, and wiping away the tears that dimmed
      her eyes, while once a cherub smile stole on her lip (<i>that smile</i> I
      once thought <i>all</i> my own;) then folding up the letter, she pressed
      it to her lips, and consigning it to her bosom, exclaimed, &ldquo;First and best
      of men!&rdquo; What else she murmured I could not distinguish; but as if the
      perusal of this prized letter had renovated every drooping spirit, she
      ceased to weep, and wrote with greater earnestness than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motionless, transfixed, I leaned for support against the frame of the
      door, until Glorvina, having finished her letter and sealed it, arose to
      depart; then I had the presence of mind to steal away and conceal myself
      in a dark recess of the corridor. Yet, though unseen, I saw her wipe away
      the traces of her tears from her cheek, and pass me with a composed and
      almost cheerful air. I softly followed, and looking down the dark abyss of
      the steep well stairs, which she rapidly descended, I perceived her put
      her letter in the hands of the little post-boy, who hurried away with it.
      Impelled by the impetuous feelings of the moment I was&mdash;yes, I was so
      far forgetful of myself, my principle, and pride, of every sentiment save
      love and jealousy, that I was on the point of following the boy, snatching
      the letter, and learning the address of this mysterious correspondent,
      this &ldquo;<i>First and best of men</i>.&rdquo; But the natural dignity of my
      vehement, yet undebased mind, saved me a meanness I should never have
      forgiven: for what right had I forcibly to possess myself of another&rsquo;s
      secret? I turned back to a window in the corridor and beheld Glor-vina&rsquo;s
      little herald mounted on his mule riding off, while she, standing at the
      gate, pursued him with that impatient look so strongly indicative of her
      ardent character. When he was out of sight she withdrew, and the next
      minute I heard her stealing towards her father&rsquo;s room. Unable to bear her
      presence, I flew to mine; that apartment I had lately occupied with a
      heart so redolent of bliss&mdash;a heart that now sunk beneath the
      unexpected blow which crushed all its new-born hopes, and I feared
      annihilated forever its sweet but shortlived felicity. &ldquo;And is this,
      then,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;the fond re-union my fancy painted in such glowing
      colours?&rdquo; God of heaven! at the very moment when my thoughts and
      affections, forced for a tedious interval from the object of their
      idolatry, like a compressed spring set free, bounded with new vigour to
      their native bias. Yet was not the disappointment of my own individual
      hope scarcely more agonizing than the destruction of that consciousness
      which, in giving one perfect being to my view, redeemed the species in my
      misanthropic opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Glorvina!&rdquo; I passionately added, &ldquo;if even thou, fair being, reared in
      thy native wilds and native solitudes art deceptive, artful, imposing,
      deep, deep in all the wiles of hypocrisy, then is the original sin of our
      nature unredeemed; vice the innate principle of our being&mdash;and those
      who preach the existence of virtue but idle dreamers who fancy that in
      others to themselves unknown And yet, sweet innocent, if thou art more
      sinned against than sinning if the phantoms of a jealous brain&mdash;oh!
      &rsquo;tis impossible! The ardent kiss impressed upon the senseless
      paper, which thy breast enshrined!!! Was the letter of a friend thus
      treasured? When was the letter of a friend thus answered with tears, with
      smiles, with blushes, and with sighs? This, this is love&rsquo;s own language.
      Besides, Glorvina is not formed for friendship; the moderate feelings of
      her burning soul are already divided in affection for her father, and
      grateful esteem for her tutor; and she who, when loved, must be loved to
      madness, will scarcely feel less passion than she inspires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While thought after thought thus chased each other down, like the mutinous
      billows of a stormy ocean, I continued pacing my chamber with quick and
      heavy strides; forgetful that the Prince&rsquo;s room lay immediately beneath
      me. Ere that thought occurred, some one softly opened the door. I turned
      savagely round&mdash;it was Glorvina! Impulsively I rushed to meet her;
      but impulsively recoiled: while she, with an exclamation of surprise and
      pleasure, sprung towards me, and by my sudden retreat would have fallen at
      my feet, but that my willing arms extended involuntarily to receive her.
      Yet, it was no longer the almost sacred person of the once all-innocent,
      all-ingenuous Glorvina they encircled; but still they twined round the
      loveliest form, the most charming, the most dangerous of human beings The
      enchantress!&mdash;With what exquisite modesty she faintly endeavoured to
      extricate herself from my embrace, yet with what willing weakness, which
      seemed to triumph in its own debility, she panted on my bosom, wearied by
      the exertion which vainly sought her release. Oh! at that moment the world
      was forgotten&mdash;the whole universe was Glorvina! My soul&rsquo;s eternal
      welfare was not more precious at that moment than Glorvina! while my
      passion seemed now to derive its ardour from the overflowing energy of
      those bitter sentiments which had preceded its revival. Glorvina, with an
      effort, flung herself from me. Virtue, indignant yet merciful, forgiving
      while it arraigned, beamed in her eyes. I fell at her feet;
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed her hand to my throbbing temples and burning lips. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo;
       I exclaimed, &ldquo;for I know not what I do.&rdquo; She threw herself on a seat, and
      covered her face with her hands, while the tears trickled through her
      fingers. Oh! there was a time when tears from those eyes&mdash;but now
      they only recalled to my recollection the last I had seen her shed. I
      started from her feet and walked towards the window, near that couch where
      her watchful and charitable attention first awakened the germ of gratitude
      and love which has since blown into such full, such fatal existence. I
      leaned my head against the window-frame for support, its painful throb was
      so violent; I felt as though it were lacerating in a thousand places; and
      the sigh which involuntarily breathed from my lips seemed almost to burst
      the heart from whence it flowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina arose: with an air tenderly compassionate, yet reproachful, she
      advanced and took one of my hands. &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what
      is the matter? has anything occurred to disturb you, or to awaken this
      extraordinary emotion? Father John! where is he? why does he not accompany
      you? Speak!&mdash;does any new misfortune threaten us? does it touch my
      father? Oh! in mercy say <i>it does not!</i> but release me from the
      torture of suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I peevishly replied; &ldquo;set your heart at rest, it is nothing;
      nothing at least that concerns you; it is me, me only it concerns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore, Mortimer, is it nothing to Glorvina,&rdquo; she softly replied,
      and with one of those natural motions so incidental to the simplicity of
      her manners, she threw her hand on my shoulder, and leaning her head on it
      raised her eloquent, her tearful eyes to mine. Oh! while the bright drops
      hung upon her cheek&rsquo;s faded rose, with what difficulty I restrained the
      impulse that tempted me to gather them with my lips; while she, like a
      ministering angel, again took my hand, and applying her fingers to my
      wrist, said, with a sad smile, &ldquo;You know I am a skilful little doctress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feelings I experienced when those lovely fingers first applied their
      pressure to my arm, rushed on my recollection: her touch had lost nothing
      of its electric power: my emotions at that moment were indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good God, how ill you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How wild your pulse; how
      feverish your looks! You have overheated yourself; you were unequal to
      such a journey in such weather; you who have been so lately an invalid. I
      beseech you to throw yourself on the bed, and endeavour to take some
      repose; meantime I will send my nurse with some refreshment to you. How
      could I be so blind as not to see at once how ill you were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad, for the present, of any pretext to conceal the nature of my real
      disorder, I confessed I was indeed ill, (and, in fact, I was <i>physically</i>
      as well as morally so; for my last day&rsquo;s journey brought on that nervous
      headach I have suffered so much from;) while she, all tender solicitude
      and compassion, flew to prepare me a composing draught. But I was not now
      to be deceived: this was pity, mere pity. Thus a thousand times have I
      seen her act by the wretches who were first introduced to her notice
      through the medium of that reputation which her distinguished humanity had
      obtained for her among the diseased and the unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had but just sunk upon the bed, overcome by fatigue and the vehemence of
      my emotions, when the old nurse entered the room. She said she had brought
      me a composing draught from the lady Glorvina, who had kissed the cup,
      after the old Irish fashion, * and bade me to drink it for her sake.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * To this ancient and general custom Goldsmith allude in his
     Deserted Village:&mdash;=
</pre>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;And kissed the cup to pass it to the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I pledge her,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with the same truth she did me,&rdquo; and I
      eagerly quaffed off the nectar her hand had prepared. Meantime the nurse
      took her station by the bed-side with some appropriate reference to her
      former attendance there, and the generosity with which that attendance was
      rewarded; for I had imprudently apportioned my donation rather to my real
      than apparent rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was glad that this talkative old woman had fallen in my way; for
      though I knew I had nothing to hope from that incorruptible fidelity which
      was grounded on her attachment to her beloved nursling, and her affection
      for the family she had so long served, yet I had everything to expect from
      the garrulous simplicity of her character, and her love of what she calls
      <i>Seanachus</i>, or telling long stories of the Inismore family; and
      while I was thinking how I should put my Jesuitical scheme into execution,
      and she was talking as usual I know not what, the beautiful &ldquo;<i>Breviare
      du Sentiment</i>&rdquo; caught my eye lying on the floor:&mdash;Glorvina must
      have dropped it on her first entrance. I desired the nurse to bring it to
      me; who blessed her stars, and wondered how her child could be so
      careless: a thing too she valued so much. At that moment it struck me that
      this <i>Brevaire</i>, the furniture of the <i>boudoir</i>, the vases, and
      the fragment of a letter, were all connected with this mysterious friend,
      this &ldquo;first and best of men.&rdquo; I shuddered as I held it, and forgot the
      snow-drops it contained; yet, assuming a composure as I examined its
      cover, I asked the nurse if she thought I could procure such another in
      the next market town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman held her sides while she laughed at the idea; then folding
      her arms on her knees with that gossiping air which she always assumed
      when in a mood peculiarly loquacious, she assured me that such a book
      could not be got in all Ireland; for that it had come from foreign parts
      to her young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who sent it?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nobody sent it, (she simply replied,) he brought it himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stammered and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I suppose,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;of course, you never heard&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I eagerly asked, with an air of curiosity and amazement. As these
      are two emotions a common mind is most susceptble of feeling and most
      anxious to excite, I found little difficulty in artfully leading on the
      old woman by degrees, till at last I obtained from her, almost unawares to
      herself, the following particulars:
    </p>
    <p>
      On a stormy night, in the spring of 17&mdash;&mdash;, during that fatal
      period when the scarcely cicatrised wounds of this unhappy country bled
      afresh beneath the uplifted sword of civil contention; when the bonds of
      human amity were rent asunder, and every man regarded his neighbour with
      suspicion or considered him with fear; a stranger of noble stature,
      muffled in a long, dark cloak, appeared in the great hall of Inismore, and
      requested an interview with the Prince. The Prince had retired to rest,
      and being then in an ill state of health, deputed his daughter to receive
      the unknown visitant, as the priest was absent. The stranger was shown
      into an apartment adjoining the Prince&rsquo;s, where Glorvina received him, and
      having remained for some time with him retired to her father&rsquo;s room; and
      again, after a conference of some minutes, returned to the stranger, whom
      she conducted to the Prince&rsquo;s bedside. On the same night, and after the
      stranger had passed two hours in the Prince&rsquo;s chamber, the nurse received
      orders to prepare the bed and apartment which I now occupy for this
      mysterious guest, who from that time remained near three months at the
      castle; leaving it only occasionally for a few days, and always departing
      and returning under the veil of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following summer he repeated his visit; bringing with him those
      presents which decorate Glorvina&rsquo;s boudoir, except the carpet and vases,
      which were brought by a person who disappeared as soon as he had left
      them. During both these visits he gave up his time chiefly to Glorvina;
      reading to her, listening to her music, and walking with her early and
      late, but never without the priest or nurse, and seldom during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, in the furor of the old woman&rsquo;s garrulity, (who, however,
      discovered that her own information had not been acquired by the most
      justifiable means, having, she said, by chance, overheard a conversation
      which passed between the stranger and the Prince,) I found that this
      mysterious visitant was some unfortunate gentleman who had attached
      himself to the rebellious faction of the day, and who being pursued nearly
      to the gates of the castle of Inismore, had thrown himself on the mercy of
      the Prince; who, with that romantic sense of honour which distinguishes
      his chivalrous character, had not violated the trust thus forced on him,
      but granted an asylum to the unfortunate refugee; who, by the most
      prepossessing manners and eminent endowments, had dazzled the fancy and
      won the hearts of this unsuspecting and credulous family; while over the
      minds of Glorvina and her father he had obtained a boundless influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse hinted that she believed it was still unsafe for the stranger to
      appear in this country for that he was more cautious of concealing himself
      in his last visit than his first; that she believed he lived in England;
      that he seemed to have money enough, &ldquo;<i>for he threw it about like a
      prince</i>.&rdquo; Not a servant in the castle, she added, but knew well enough
      how it was; but there was not one but would sooner <i>die</i> than betray
      him. His name she did not know; he was only known by the appellation of
      the gentleman. He was not young, but tall and very handsome. He could not
      speak Irish, and she had reason to think he had lived chiefly in America.
      She added, that <i>I</i> often reminded her of him, especially when I
      smiled and looked down. She was not certain whether he was expected that
      summer or not; but she believed the Prince frequently received letters
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was by no means aware how deeply she had been betrayed by
      her insatiate passion for hearing herself speak; while the curious and
      expressive idiom of her native tongue gave me more insight into the whole
      business than the most laboured phrase or minute detail could have done.
      By the time, however, she had finished her narrative, she began to have
      some &ldquo;compunctious visitings of conscience.&rdquo; she made me pass my honour I
      would not betray her to her young lady; for, she added, that if it got air
      it might come to the ears of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; who was
      the prince&rsquo;s bitter enemy; and that it might be the ruin of the Prince;
      with a thousand other wild surmises suggested by her fears. I again
      repeated my assurances of secrecy; and the sound of her young lady&rsquo;s bell
      summoning her to the Prince&rsquo;s room, she left me, not forgetting to take
      with her the &ldquo;<i>Breviare du Sentiment</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again abandoned to my wretched self, the succeeding hour was passed in
      such a state of varied perturbation, that it would be as torturing to
      retrace my agonizing and successive reflections as it would be impossible
      to express them. In short, after a thousand vague conjectures, many to the
      prejudice, and a lingering few to the advantage of their object, I was led
      to believe (fatal conviction!) that the virgin rose of Glorvina&rsquo;s
      affection had already shed its sweetness on a former, happier lover; and
      the partiality I had flattered myself in having awakened, was either the
      result of natural intuitive coquetry, or, in the long absence of her
      heart&rsquo;s first object, a transient beam of that fire, which once illumined,
      is so difficult to extinguish, and which was nourished by my resemblance
      to him who had first fanned it into life.&mdash;What! <i>I</i> receive to
      my heart the faded spark, while another has basked in the vital flame! <i>I</i>
      contentedly gather this after-blow of tenderness, when another has inhaled
      the very essence of the nectarious blossoms? No! like the suffering
      mother, who wholly resigned her bosom&rsquo;s idol rather than divide it with
      another, I will, with a single effort, tear this late adored image from my
      heart, though that heart break with the effort, rather than feed on the
      remnant of those favours on which another has already feasted. Yet to be
      thus deceived by a recluse, a child, a novice!&mdash;<i>I</i> who, turning
      revoltingly from the hackneyed artifices of female depravity in that world
      where art forever reigns, sought in the tenderness of secluded innocence
      and intelligent simplicity that heaven my soul had so long, so vainly
      panted to enjoy! Yet, even there&mdash;No! I cannot believe it She!
      Glofvina, false, deceptive! Oh, were the immaculate spirit of <i>Truth</i>
      embodied in a human form, it could not wear upon its radient brow a
      brighter, stronger trace of purity inviolable, and holy innocence than
      shines in the seraph countenance of Glorvina!
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, she never <i>said</i> she loved me. <i>Said!</i>&mdash;God of
      heaven! were words then necessary for such an <i>avowal!</i> Oh, Glorvina!
      thy melting glances, thy insidious smiles, thy ardent blushes, thy tender
      sighs, thy touching softness, and delicious tears; these, these are the
      sweet testimonies to which my heart appeals. These at least will speak for
      me, and say it was not the breath of vain presumption that nourished those
      hopes which now, in all their vigour, perish by the chilling blight of
      well-founded jealousy and mortal disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours have elapsed since the nurse left me, supposing me to be asleep;
      no one has intruded, and I have employed the last hour in retracing to you
      the vicissitudes of this eventful day. You, who warned me of my fate,
      should learn the truth of your fatal prophecy. My father&rsquo;s too; but he is
      avenged! and I have already expiated a deception, which, however innocent,
      was still <i>deception</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IN CONTINUATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I had written thus far, when some one tapped at my door, and the next
      moment the priest entered: he was not an hour arrived, and with his usual
      kindness came to inquire after my health, expressing much surprise at its
      alteration, which he said was visible in my looks. &ldquo;But, it is scarcely to
      be wondered at,&rdquo; he added: &ldquo;a man who complains for two days of a nervous
      disorder, and yet gallops, as if for life, seven miles in a day more
      natural to the torrid zone than our polar clime, may have some chance of
      losing his life, but very little of <i>losing his disorder</i>.&rdquo; He then
      endeavoured to persuade me to go down with him and take some refreshment,
      for I had tasted nothing all day, save Glorvina&rsquo;s draught; but finding me
      averse to the proposal, he sat with me till he was sent for to the
      Prince&rsquo;s room. As soon as he was gone, with that restlessness of body
      which ever accompanies a wretched mind, I wandered through the deserted
      rooms of this vast and ruinous edifice, but saw nothing of Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set, all was gloomy and still, I took my hat and in the
      melancholy maze of twilight, wandered I knew not, cared not whither. I had
      not, however, strayed far from the ruins, when I perceived the little
      postboy galloping his foaming mule over the drawbridge, and the next
      moment saw Glorvina gliding beneath the colonnade (that leads to the
      chapel) to meet him. I retreated behind a fragment of the ruins, and
      observed her to take a letter from his hand with an eager and impatient
      air: when she had looked at the seal, she pressed it to her lips: then by
      the faint beams of the retreating light, she opened this welcome packet,
      and putting an enclosed letter in her bosom, endeavoured to read the
      envelope; but scarcely had her eye glanced over it, than it fell to the
      earth, while she, covering her face with her hands, seemed to lean against
      the broken pillar near which she stood for support. Oh! was this an
      emotion of overwhelming bliss, or chilling disappointment? She again took
      the paper, and still holding it open in her hand, with a slow step and
      thoughtful air, returned to the castle; while I flew to the stables under
      pretence of inquiring from the post-boy if there were any letters for me.
      The lad said there was but one, and that, the postmaster had told him was
      an English one for the lady Glorvina. This letter, then, though it could
      not have been an answer to that I had seen her writing, was doubtless from
      the mysterious friend, whose friendship, &ldquo;<i>like gold, though not
      sonorous, was indestructible</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My doubts were now all lost in certain conviction; my trembling heart no
      longer vibrated between a lingering hope and a dreadful fear. I was <i>deceived</i>
      and another was <i>beloved</i>. That sort of sullen firm composure, which
      fixes on man when he knows the worst that can occur, took possession of
      every feeling, and steadied that wild throb of insupportable suspense
      which had agitated and distracted my veering soul; while the only
      vacillation of mind to which I was sensible, was the uncertainty of
      whether I should or should not quit the castle that night. Finally, I
      resolved to act with the cool determination of a rational being, not the
      wild impetuosity of a maniac. I put off my departure till the following
      morning, when I would formally take leave of the Prince, the priest, and
      even Glorvina herself, in the presence of her father. Thus firm and
      decided, I returned to the castle, and mechanically walked towards that
      vast apartment where I had first seen her at her harp, soothing the
      sorrows of parental affliction; but now it was gloomy and unoccupied; a
      single taper burned on a black marble slab before a large folio, in which
      I suppose the priest had been looking; the silent harp of Glorvina stood
      in its usual place. I fled to the great hall, once the central point of
      all our social joys, but it was also dark and empty; the whole edifice
      seemed a desert. I again rushed from its portals, and wandered along the
      sea-beat shore, till the dews of night and the spray of the swelling tide,
      as it broke against the rocks, had penetrated through my clothes. I saw
      the light trembling in the casement of Glorvina&rsquo;s chamber long after
      midnight. I heard the castle clock fling its peal over every passing hour;
      and not till the faintly awakening beam of the horizon streamed on the
      eastern wave, did I return through the castle&rsquo;s ever open portals, and
      steal to that room I was about to occupy (not to sleep in) for the last
      time: a light and some refreshment had been left there for me in my
      absence. The taper was nearly burned out, but by its expiring flame I
      perceived a billet lying on the table. I opened it tremblingly. It was
      from Glor-vina, and only a simple inquiry after my health, couched in
      terms of commonplace courtesy. I tore it&mdash;it was the first she had
      ever addressed to me, and yet I tore it in a thousand pieces. I threw
      myself on the bed, and for some time busied my mind in conjecturing
      whether her father sanctioned or her preceptor suspected her attachment to
      this fortunate rebel. I was almost convinced they did not. The young, the
      profound deceiver; she whom I had thought
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;So green in this old world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearied by incessant cogitation, I at last fell into a deep sleep, and
      arose about two hours back, harassed by dreams and quite unrefreshed,
      since when I have written thus far. My last night&rsquo;s resolution remains
      unchanged. I have sent my compliments to inquire after the Prince&rsquo;s
      health, and to request an interview with him. The servant has this moment
      returned, and informs me the Prince has just fallen asleep after having
      had a very bad night, but that when he awakens he shall be told of my
      request. I dared not mention Glorvina&rsquo;s name, but the man informed me she
      was then sitting by her father&rsquo;s bedside, and had not attended matins. At
      breakfast I mean to acquaint the excellent Father John of my intended
      departure. Oh! how much of the woman at this moment swells in my heart.
      There is not a being in this family in whom I have not excited, and for
      whom I do not feel an interest. Poor souls! they have almost all been at
      my room door this morning to inquire after my health, owing to the nurse&rsquo;s
      exaggerated account: she too, kind creature, has already been twice with
      me before I arose, but I affected sleep. Adieu! I shall despatch this to
      you from M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house. I shall then have seen the
      castle of Inismore for the last time&mdash;the last time!!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is all over&mdash;the
      spell is dissolved, and the vision forever vanished: yet my mind is not
      what it was, ere this transient dream of bliss &ldquo;wrapt it in Elysium.&rdquo; Then
      I neither suffered nor enjoyed: now&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I folded my letter to you, I descended to breakfast, but the priest
      did not appear, and the things were removed untouched. I ordered my horse
      to be got ready, and waited all the day in expectation of a message from
      the Prince, loitering, wandering, unsettled, and wretched, the hours
      dragged on; no message came: I fancied I was impatient to receive it, and
      to be gone; but the truth is, my dear friend, I was weak enough almost to
      rejoice at the detention. While I walked from room to room with a book in
      my hand, I saw no one but the servants, who looked full of mystery; save
      once, when, as I stood at the top of the corridor, I perceived Glorvina
      leave her father&rsquo;s room; she held a handkerchief to her eyes, and passed
      on to her own apartment. Oh! why did I not fly and wipe away those tears,
      inquire their source, and end at once the torture of suspense? but I had
      not power to move. The dinner hour arrived; I was sum moned to the
      parlour; the priest met me at the table, shook me with unusual cordiality
      by the hand, and affectionately inquired after my health. He then became
      silent and thoughtful, and had the air of a man whose heart and office are
      at variance; who is deputed with a commission his feelings will not suffer
      him to execute. After a long pause, he spoke of the Prince&rsquo;s illness, the
      uneasiness of his mind, the unpleasant state of his affairs, his
      attachment and partiality to me, and his ardent wish always to have it in
      his power to retain me with him; then paused again, and sighed, and again
      endeavoured to speak, but failed in the effort. I now perfectly understood
      the nature of his incoherent speech; my pride served as an interpreter
      between his feelings and my own, and I was determined to save his honest
      heart the pang of saying, &ldquo;Go, you are no longer a welcome guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him then in a few words, that it was my intention to have left the
      castle that morning for Bally&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, on my way to
      England; but that I waited for an opportunity of bidding farewell to the
      Prince: as that, however, seemed to be denied me, I begged that he (Father
      John) would have the goodness to say for me all&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. Had
      my life depended on it, I could not articulate another word. The priest
      arose in evident emotion. I, too, not unagitated, left my seat: the good
      man took my hand, and pressed it affectionately to his heart, then turned
      aside, I believe, to conceal the moisture of his eyes; nor were mine dry,
      yet they seemed to burn in their sockets. The priest then put a paper in
      the hand he held, and again pressing it with ardour, hurried away. I
      trembled as I opened it; it was a letter from the Prince, containing a
      bank note, a plain ring which he constantly wore, and the following lines
      written with the trembling hand of infirmity or emotion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Young and interesting Englishman, farewell! Had I not known
     thee, I never had lamented that God had not blessed me with
     a son.

     &ldquo;O&rsquo;Melville,

     &ldquo;Prince of Inismore.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I sunk, overcome in a chair. When I could sufficiently command myself, I
      wrote with my pencil on the cover of the Prince&rsquo;s letter the following
      incoherent lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe <i>me</i> nothing: to you I stand indebted for life itself, and
      all that could <i>once</i> render life desirable. With existence only will
      the recollection of your kindness be lost; yet though generously it was
      unworthily bestowed; for it was lavished on an <i>Impostor</i>. I am not
      what I seem: To become an inmate in your family, to awaken an interest in
      your estimation, I forfeited the dignity of truth, and stooped for the
      first time to the meanness of deception. Your money, therefore, I return,
      but your ring&mdash;that ring so often worn by you&mdash;worlds would not
      tempt me to part with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a father, sir; this father once so dear, so precious to my heart!
      but since I have been your guest, <i>he</i>, the whole world was
      forgotten. The first tie of nature was dissolved; and from your hands I
      seemed to have received a new existence. Best and most generous of men, be
      this recollection present to your heart: Should some incident as yet
      unforeseen discover to you who and what I am, remember this&mdash;and then
      forgive him, who, with the profoundest sense of your goodness, bids you a
      last farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished these lines written with an emotion that almost
      rendered them illegible, I rung the bell and inquired (from the servant
      who answered) for the priest: he said he was shut up in the Prince&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, with the Prince?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;for he had seen the lady Glorvina enter at the same
      time with Father John.&rdquo; I did not wish to trust the servant with this open
      billet, I did not wish the Prince to get it till I was gone: in a word,
      though I was resolved to leave the castle that evening, yet I did not wish
      to go, till, for the last time, I had seen Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore wrote the following lines in French to the priest. &ldquo;Suffer me
      to see you; in a few minutes I shall leave Inismore forever.&rdquo; As I was
      putting the billet into the man s hand, the stable-boy passed the window;
      I threw up the sash and ordered him to lead round my horse. All this was
      done with the agitation of mind which a criminal feels who hurries on his
      execution, to terminate the horrors of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continued walking up and down the room in such agony of feeling, that a
      cold dew, colder than ice, hung upon my aching brow. I heard a footstep
      approach&mdash;I became motionless; the door opened, and the priest
      appeared, leading in Glorvina. God of Heaven! The priest supported her on
      his arm, the veil was drawn over her eyes; I could not advance to meet
      them, I stood spellbound,&mdash;they both approached; I had not the power
      to raise my eyes. &ldquo;You sent for me,&rdquo; said the priest, in a faltering
      accent. I presented him my letter for the Prince; suffocation choked my
      utterance; I could not speak. He put the letter in his bosom, and taking
      my hand, said, &ldquo;You must not think of leaving this evening; the Prince
      will not hear of it.&rdquo; While he spoke my horse passed the window; I
      summoned up those spirits my pride, my wounded pride, retained in its
      service. &ldquo;It is necessary I should depart immediately,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the
      sultriness of the weather renders the evening preferable.&rdquo; I abruptly
      paused&mdash;I could not finish the sentence, simple as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;<i>any</i> evening will do as well as this.&rdquo; But
      Glorvina spoke not; and I answered with vehemence, that I should have been
      off long since: and my determination is now fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are thus <i>positive</i>,&rdquo; said the priest, surprised by a manner
      so unusual, &ldquo;your friend, your pupil here, who came to second her father&rsquo;s
      request, must change her solicitations to a last farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina&rsquo;s head reposed on his shoulder; her face was enveloped in her
      veil; he looked on her with tenderness and compassion, and I repeated, a
      &ldquo;last farewell!&rdquo; Glorvina, you will at least then say, &ldquo;<i>Farewell</i>.&rdquo;
       The veil fell from her face. God of Heaven, what a countenance! In the
      universe I saw nothing but Glorvina; such as I had once believed her, my
      own, my loving and beloved Glorvina, my tender friend, and impassioned
      mistress. I fell at her feet; I seized her hands and pressed them to my
      burning lips. I heard her stifled sobs; her tears of soft compassion fell
      upon my cheek; I thought them tears of love, and drew her to my breast;
      but the priest held her in one arm, while with the other he endeavoured to
      raise me, exclaiming in violent emotion, &ldquo;O God, I should have foreseen
      this! I, I alone am to blame. Excellent and unfortunate young man, dearly
      beloved child!&rdquo; and at the same moment he pressed us both to his paternal
      bosom. The heart of Glorvina throbbed to mine, our tears flowed together,
      our sighs mingled. The priest sobbed over us like a child. It was a
      blissful agony; but it was insupportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to have died would have been most blessed The priest dispelled the
      transient dream. He forcibly put me from him. He stifled the voice of
      nature and pity in his breast. His air was sternly virtuous&mdash;&ldquo;Go,&rdquo;
       said he, but he spoke in vain. I still clung to the drapery of Glorvina&rsquo;s
      robe; he forced me from her, and she sunk on a couch. &ldquo;I now,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;behold the fatal error to which I have been an unconscious accessary.
      Thank God, it is retrievable; go, amiable, but imprudent young man; it is
      honour, it is virtue commands your departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke he had almost dragged me to the hall. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said I, in a
      faint voice, &ldquo;let me but speak to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in vain,&rdquo; replied the inexorable priest, &ldquo;for she can <i>never</i>
      be yours; then spare <i>her</i>, spare <i>yourself</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he firmly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I burst from his grasp and flew to Glorvina. I snatched her to my breast
      and wildly cried, &ldquo;Glorvina, is this then a last farewell?&rdquo; She answered
      not, but her silence was eloquent. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, pressing her more
      closely to my heart, &ldquo;<i>farewell forever!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IN CONTINUATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I mounted the horse that waited for me at the door, and galloped off; but
      with the darkness of the night I returned, and all night I wandered about
      the environs of Inismore: to the last I watched the light of Glorvina&rsquo;s
      window. When it was extinguished, it seemed as though I parted from her
      again. A gray dawn was already breaking to the mists of obscurity. Some
      poor peasants were already going to the labours of the day. It was
      requisite I should go. Yet when I ascended the mountain of Inismore I
      involuntarily turned, and beheld those dear ruins which I had first
      entered under the influence of such powerful, such prophetic emotion. What
      a train of recollections rushed on my mind, what a climax did they form! I
      turned away my eyes, sick, <i>sick</i> at <i>heart</i>, and pursued my
      solitary journey. Within twelve miles of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house, as I reached an eminence, I again paused to look back, and caught a
      last view of the mountain of Inismore. It seemed to float like a vapour on
      the horizon. I took a last farewell of this almost loved mountain. Once it
      had risen on my gaze like the pharos to my haven of enjoyment; for never,
      until this sad moment, had I beheld it but with transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my arrival here I found a letter from my father, simply stating that by
      the time it reached me he would probably be on his way to Ireland,
      accompanied by my intended bride, and her father, concluding thus: &ldquo;In
      beholding you honourably and happily established, thus secure in a
      liberal, a noble independence, the throb of incessant solicitude you have
      hitherto awakened will at last be <i>stilled</i>, and your prudent
      compliance in this instance will bury in eternal oblivion the sufferings,
      the anxieties which, with all your native virtue and native talent, your
      imprudence has hitherto caused to the heart of an affectionate and
      indulgent father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter, which even a few days back would have driven me to
      distraction, I now read with the apathy of a stoic. It is to me a matter
      of indifference how I am disposed of. I have no wish, no will of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the return of that mortal torpor from which a late fatally cherished
      sentiment had roused me, is now added the pang of my life&rsquo;s severest
      disappointment, like the dying wretch who is only roused from total
      insensibility, by the quivering pains which, at intervals of fluttering
      life, shoot through his languid frame.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IN CONTINUATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is two days since I began this letter, yet I am still here; I have not
      power to move, though I know not what secret spell detains me. But whither
      shall I go, and to what purpose? the tie which once bound me to physical
      and moral good, to virtue and felicity, is broken, for ever broken. My
      mind is changed, dreadfully changed within these few days. I am ill too, a
      burning fever preys upon the very springs of life; all around me is
      solitary and desolate. Sometimes my brain seems on fire, and hideous
      phantoms float before my eyes; either my senses are disordered by
      indisposition, or the hand of heaven presses heavily on me. My blood rolls
      in torrents through my veins. Sometimes I think it <i>should</i>, it <i>must</i>
      have vent. I feel it is in vain to think that I shall ever be fit for the
      discharge of any duty in this life. I shall hold a place in the creation
      to which I am a dishonour. I shall become a burthen to the few who are
      obliged to feel an interest in my welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the duty of every one to do that which his situation requires, to
      act up to the measure of judgment bestowed on him by Providence. Should I
      continue to drag on this load of life, it would be for its wretched
      remnant a mere animal existence. A moral death! What! I become again like
      the plant I tread under my feet; endued with a vegetative existence, but
      destitute of all sensation of all feeling. I who have tasted heaven&rsquo;s own
      bliss; who have known, oh God! that even the recollection, the simple
      recollection should diffuse through my chilled heart, through my whole
      languid frame such cheering renovating ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have gone over calmly, deliberately gone over every circumstance
      connected with the recent dream of my life. It is evident that the object
      of my heart&rsquo;s first election is that of her father&rsquo;s choice. Her passion
      for me, for I swear most solemnly she loved me: Oh, in that I could not be
      deceived; every look, every word betrayed it; her passion for me was a
      paroxysm. Her tender, her impassioned nature required some object to
      receive the glowing ebullitions of its affectionate feelings; and in the
      absence of another, in that unrestrained intimacy by which we were so
      closely associated; in that sympathy of pursuit which existed between us,
      they were lavished on me. I was the substituted toy of the moment. And
      shall I then sink beneath a woman&rsquo;s whim, a woman&rsquo;s infidelity, unfaithful
      to another as to me? I who, from my early days, have suffered by her arts
      and my own credulity? But what were all my sufferings to this? A drop of
      water to &ldquo;the multitudinous ocean.&rdquo; Yet in the moment of a last farewell
      she wept so bitterly! tears of pity! Pitied and deceived!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am resolved I will offer myself an expiatory sacrifice on the altar of
      parental wrongs. The father whom I have deceived and injured shall be
      retributed. This moment I have received a letter from him, the most
      affectionate and tender; he is arrived in Dublin, and with him Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and his daughter! It is well! If he requires it the moment of our meeting
      shall be that of my immolation. Some act of desperation would <i>be</i>
      now most consonant to my soul!

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> am writing to you
      from the back-room of a noisy hotel in the centre of a great and bustling

      lately dwelt&mdash;those wild sublimities of nature&mdash;the stupendous
      mountain, the Alpine cliff, the boundless ocean, and the smiling vale
      Where are those original and simple characters, those habits, those

      I arrived here late in the evening, and found my father waiting to receive
      me. Happily the rest of the party were gone to the theatre; for his
      agitation was scarcely less than my own. You know that, owing to our late
      misunderstanding, it is some months since we met. He fell on my neck and
      wept. I was quite overcome. He was shocked at my altered appearance, and
      his tenderest solicitudes were awakened for my health. I was so vanquished
      by his goodness, that more than once I was on the point of confessing all
      to him. It was my good angel checked the imprudent avowal: for what
      purpose could it now serve, but to render me more contemptible in his
      eyes, and to heighten his antipathy against those who have been in some
      degree the unconscious accessaries to my egregious folly and incurable
      imprudence. But <i>does</i> he feel an antipathy against the worthy
      Prince? Can it be otherwise? Have not all his conciliatory offers been
      rejected with scorn?&mdash;Yet to me he never mentioned the Prince&rsquo;s name;
      this silence surprises me&mdash;long may it continue. I dare not trust
      myself. In your bosom only is the secret safely reposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had rode day and night since I left M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;house,
      weariness and indisposition obliged me almost on my arrival to go to bed:
      my father sat by my side till the return of the party from the theatre.
      What plans for my future aggrandizement and happiness did his parental
      solicitude canvass and devise! the prospect of my brilliant establishment
      in life seems to have given him a new sense of being. On our return to
      England, I am to set up for the borough of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      My talents are calculated for the senate: fame, dignity, and emolument,
      are to wait upon their successful exertion. I am to become an object of
      popular favour and royal esteem; and all this time, in the fancied triumph
      of his parental hopes, he sees not that the heart of their object is
      breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you to hear him! were you to see him. What a father! what a man! Such
      intelligence&mdash;such abilities. A mind so dignified&mdash;a heart so
      tender! and still retaining all the ardour, all the enthusiasm of youth.
      In what terms he spoke of my elected bride! He indeed dwelt chiefly on her
      personal charms, and the simplicity of her unmodified character. Alas! I
      once found both united to genius and sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful, (he exclaimed) to form this young and ductile mind, to
      mould it to your desires, to breathe inspiration into this lovely image of
      primeval innocence, to give soul to beauty, and intelligence to
      simplicity; to watch the rising progress of your grateful efforts, and
      finally clasp to your heart that perfection you have yourself created.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was spoken with an energy, an enthusiasm, as though he had
      himself experienced all the pleasure he now painted for me. Happily,
      however, in the warmth of his own feelings, he perceived not the coldness,
      the torpidity of his son&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are fast weaving for me the web of my destiny. I look on and take no
      part in the work. It is over&mdash;I have been presented in form. They say
      she is beautiful&mdash;it may be so;&mdash;but the blind man cannot be
      persuaded of the charms of the rose, when his finger is wounded by its
      thorns. She met me with some confusion, which was natural, considering she
      had been &ldquo;won unsought.&rdquo; Yet I thought it was the bashfulness of a <i>hoyden</i>,
      rather than that soul-born delicate bashfulness which I have seen
      accompanied with every grace. How few there are who do or can distinguish
      this in woman; yet in nature there is nothing more distinct than the
      modesty of sentiment and of constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father was, as usual, boisterously good-humoured, and vulgarly
      pleasant; he talked over our sporting adventures last winter, as if the
      topic were exhaustless. For my part, I was so silent, that my father
      looked uneasy, and I then made amends for my former taciturnity by talking
      incessantly, and on every subject, with vehemence and rapidity. A woman of
      common sense or common delicacy, would have been disgusted; but she is a
      child. They would fain drag me after them into public, but my plea of ill
      health has been received by my indulgent father. My gay young mistress
      seems already to consider me as her husband, and treats me accordingly
      with indifference. In short, she finds that love in the solitude of the
      country, and amidst the pleasures of the town, is a very different
      sentiment; yet her vanity, I believe, is piqued by my neglect; for to-day
      she said, when I excused myself from accompanying her to a morning
      concert, Oh! I should much rather have your father with me, he is the
      younger man of the two: I indeed never saw him in such health and spirits;
      he seems to tread on air. Oh! that he were my rival, my successful rival!
      In the present morbid state of my feelings I give in to every thing; but
      when it comes to a crisis, will this stupid acquiescence still befriend
      their wishes? Impossible!
    </p>
    <h3>
      IN CONTINUATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have had a short but extraordinary conversation with my father. Would
      you believe it? he has for some time back cherished an attachment of the
      tenderest nature; but to his heart, the interests of his children have
      ever been an object of the first and dearest concern. Having secured their
      establishment in life, and as he hopes and believes, effected their
      happiness, he now feels himself warranted in consulting his own. In short,
      he has given me to understand that there is a probability of his marriage
      with a very amiable and deserving person, closely following after my
      brother&rsquo;s and mine. The lady&rsquo;s name he refused to mention, until every
      thing was finally arranged; and whoever she is, I suspect her rank is
      inferior to her merits, for he said, &ldquo;The world will call the union
      disproportioned&mdash;disproportioned in every sense; but I must in this
      instance, prefer the approval of my own heart to the world&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo; He
      then added, (equivocally) that had he been able to follow me immediately
      to Ireland, as he had at first proposed, he would have related to me some
      circumstances of peculiar interest, but that <i>I should yet know all</i>
      and seemed, I thought, to lament that disparity of character between my
      brother and him, which prohibited that flow of confidence his heart seems
      panting to indulge in. You know Edward takes no pains to conceal that he
      smiles at those ardent virtues in his father&rsquo;s character, to which the
      phlegmatic temperament of his own gives the name of <i>romance</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two fathers settle every thing as they please. A property which fell
      to my father a few weeks back, by the death of a rich maiden aunt, with
      every thing not entailed, he has made over to me, even during his life.
      Expostulation was in vain, he would not hear me:&mdash;for himself he has
      retained nothing but his purchased estates in Connaught, which are
      infinitely more extensive than that he possesses by inheritance. What if
      he resides at the Lodge, in the very neighbourhood of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?
      Oh! my good friend, I fear I am deceiving myself: I fear I am preparing
      for the heart of the best of fathers, a mortal disappointment. When the
      throes of wounded pride shall have subsided, when the resentments of a
      doat-ing, a deceived heart, shall have gradually abated, and the
      recollection of former blisses shall have soothed away the pangs of recent
      suffering; will I then submit to the dictates of an imperious duty, or
      resign myself unresisting to the influence of morbid apathy?

      Sometimes my father fixes his eyes so tenderly on me, yet with a look as
      if he would search to the most secret folds of my heart. He has never once
      asked my opinion of my elected bride, who, gay and happy as the first
      circles of this dissipated city can make her, cheerfully receives the plea
      which ill health affords (attributed to a heavy cold) of not attending her
      in her pursuit of pleasure. The fact is, I am indeed ill; my mind and body
      seem declining together, and nothing in this world can give me joy, but
      the prospect of its delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this I suppose the mysterious friend is arrived. It was expedient,
      therefore, that I should be dismissed. By this I suppose she is....
    </p>
    <p>
      So closely does my former weakness cling round my heart, that I cannot
      think of it without madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having contemplated for a few minutes the sun&rsquo;s cloudless radiancy,
      the impression left on the averted gaze is two dark spots, and the dazzled
      organ becomes darkened by a previous excess of lumination. It is thus with
      my mind; its present gloom is proportioned to its former light. Oh! it was
      too, too much! Rescued from that moral death, that sickbed satiety of
      feeling, that state of chill, hopeless existence, in which the torpid
      faculties were impalpable to every impression, when to breathe, to move,
      constituted all the powers of being: and then suddenly, as if by
      intervention of Providence (and what an agent did it appoint for the
      execution of its divine will!) raised to the summit of human thought,
      human feeling, human felicity, only again to be plunged in endless night.
      It was too much.

      Good God! would you believe it! My father is gone to M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;house,
      to prepare for the reception of the bridal party. We are to follow, and he
      proposes spending the summer there; there too, he says, my marriage with
      Miss D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is to be celebrated; he wishes to conciliate
      the good will, not only of the neighbouring gentry, but of his tenantry in
      general, and thinks this will be a fair occasion. Well be it so; but I
      shall not hold myself answerable for the consequences: my destiny is in
      their hands&mdash;let them look to the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since my father left us, I am of necessity obliged to pay some attention
      to <i>his friends</i>; but I should be a mere automaton by the side of my
      gay mistress, did I not court an artificial flow of spirits, by means to
      me the most detestable. In short, I generally contrive to leave my senses
      behind me at the drinking table; or rather my reason and my spirits,
      profiting by its absence, are roused to boisterous anarchy: my bride (<i>my</i>
      bride!) is then quite charmed with my gaiety, and fancies she is receiving
      the homage of a lover, when she is insulted by the extravagance of a
      maniac; but she is a simple child, and her father is an insensible fool.
      God knows how little of my thoughts are devoted to either. Yet the girl is
      much followed for her beauty, and the splendid figure which the fortune of
      the father enables them to make, has procured them universal attention
      from persons of the first rank.

      A thousand times the dream of short slumbers gives her to my arms as I
      last beheld her. A thousand times I am awakened from a heavy unrefreshing
      sleep by the fancied sound of her harp and voice. There was one old Irish
      air she used to sing like an angel, and in the idiom of her national music
      sighed out certain passages with a heart-breaking thrill, that used to
      rend my very soul! Well, this song I cannot send from my memory; it
      breathes around me, it dies upon my ear, and in the weakness of emotion I
      weep&mdash;weep like a child. Oh! this cannot be much longer endured. I
      have this moment received your letter; I feel all the kindness of your
      intention, but I must insist on your not coming over; it would now answer
      no purpose. Besides, a new plan of conduct has suggested itself. In a
      word, my father shall know all: my unfortunate adventure may come to his
      ears: it is best he should know it from myself. I will then resign my fate
      into his hands: surely he will not forget I am still his son. Adieu.

      CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days after the departure of the Earl of M. from Dublin, the intended
      father-in-law of his son, weary of a town-life, to which he had hitherto
      been unaccustomed, proposed that they should surprise the earl at M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house, without waiting for that summons which was to have governed their
      departure for Connaught.
    </p>
    <p>
      His young and thoughtless daughter, eager only after novelty, was charmed
      by a plan which promised a change of scene and variety of life. The
      unfortunate lover of Glorvina fancied he gave a reluctant compliance to
      the proposal which coincided but too closely with the secret desires of
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inconsiderate project was put into execution almost as soon as
      formed. Mr. D. and his daughter went in their own carriage; Mr. M.
      followed on horseback. On their arrival, they found M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house occupied by workmen of every description, and the Earl of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clendinning, his lordship&rsquo;s agent, had not returned from England; and
      the steward, who had been but lately appointed to the office, informed the
      travellers that Lord M. had only been one day at M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house, and had removed a few miles up the country to a hunting-lodge until
      it should be ready for the reception of the family. Mr. D. insisted on
      going on to the hunting-lodge. Mr. M. strenuously opposed the intention,
      and with difficulty prevailed on the thoughtless father and volatile
      daughter to stop at M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; house, while he went in
      search of its absent lord. It was early in the day when they had arrived,
      and when Mr. M. had given orders for their accommodation, he set out for
      the Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time the unhappy M. had come within the sight of those scenes
      which recalled all the recent circumstances of his life to memory, his
      heart had throbbed with a quickened pulse; even the scenery of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house had awakened his emotion; his enforced return thither; his brief and
      restless residence there; and the eager delight with which he flew from
      the desolate mansion of his father to the endearing circle of Inismore all
      rushed to his memory, and awakened that train of tender recollection he
      had lately endeavoured to stifle. Happy to seize on an occasion of
      escaping from the restraints the society of his insensible companions
      imposed, happier still to have an opportunity afforded him of visiting the
      neighbourhood of Inismore, every step of his journey to the Lodge was
      marked by the renewed existence of some powerful and latent emotion; and
      the latent agitation of his heart and feelings had reached their <i>acme</i>
      by the time he had arrived at the gate of that avenue from which the
      mountains of Inismore were discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had reached the Lodge, a young lad, who was working in the
      grounds, replied to his inquiries, that an old woman was its only
      resident, that the ancient steward was dead, and that Lord M. had only
      remained there an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last intelligence overwhelmed Mr. M. with astonishment. To his
      further inquiries the boy only said, that as the report went that M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house was undergoing some repair, it was probable his lord had gone on a
      visit to some of the <i>neighbouring quality</i>. He added that his lord
      ship&rsquo;s own gentleman had accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M. remained for a considerable time lost in thought; then throwing the
      bridle over his horse&rsquo;s neck, folded his arms, and suffered it to take its
      own course: it was the same animal which had so often carried him to
      Inismore. When he had determined on following his father to the Lodge he
      had ordered a fresh horse; that which the groom led out was the same which
      Mr. M. had left behind him, and which, by becoming the companion of his
      singular adventure, had obtained a peculiar interest in his affections.
      When he had passed the avenue of the Lodge, the animal instinctively took
      to that path he had been accustomed to go; his instinct was too favourable
      to the secret wishes of the heart of his unhappy master; he smiled sadly,
      and suffered him to proceed. The evening was far advanced the sun had sunk
      in the horizon, as from an eminence he perceived the castle of Inismore.
      His heart throbbed with violence&mdash;a thousand hopes, a thousand
      wishes, a thousand fears agitated his breast: he dared not for a moment
      listen to the suggestions of either. Lost in the musings of his heart and
      imagination, he was already within a mile of Inismore. The world now
      disappeared&mdash;he descended rapidly to a wild and trackless shore,
      screened from the high road by a range of inaccessible cliffs. Twilight
      faintly lingered on the summit of the mountains only: the tide was out;
      and, crossing the strand, he found himself beneath those stupendous cliffs
      which shelter the western part of the peninsula of Inismore from the
      ocean. The violence of the waves had worn several defiles through the
      rocks, which commanded a near view of the <i>ruined castle</i>: it was
      involved in gloom and silence&mdash;all was dark, still, and solemn!&mdash;No
      lights issued from the windows&mdash;no noise cheered at intervals the
      silence of desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A secret impulse still impelled the steps of Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and the darkness of the night favoured his irresistible desire to satisfy
      the longings of his enamoured heart, by taking a last look at the shrine
      of its still worshipped idol. He proceeded cautiously through the rocks,
      and alighting, fastened his horse near a patch of herbage; then advanced
      towards the chapel&mdash;its gates were open&mdash;the silence of death
      hung over it. The rising moon, as it shone through the broken casements,
      flung round a dim religious light, and threw its quivering rays on <i>that</i>
      spot where he had first beheld Glorvina and her father engaged in the
      interesting ceremonies of their religion. And to think that even at that
      moment he breathed the air that she respired, and was within a few paces
      of the spot she inhabited!&mdash;Overcome by the conviction, he resigned
      himself to the delirium which involved his heart and senses; and, governed
      by the overpowering impulse of the moment, he proceeded along that
      colonade through which he had distinctly followed her and the Prince on
      the night of his first arrival at the castle. It seemed to his heated
      brain as though he still pursued those fine and striking forms which
      almost appeared but the phantoms of fancy&rsquo;s creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On every mourning breeze he thought the sound of Glorvina&rsquo;s voice was
      borne; and starting at the fall of every leaf, he almost expected to meet
      at each step the form of Father John, if not that of his faithless
      mistress; but the idea of her lover occurred not. The review of scenes so
      dear awakened only a recollection of past enjoyments; and in the fond
      dream of memory his present sufferings were for an interval suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely aware of the approximation, he had already reached the lawn which
      fronted the castle, and which was strewed over with fragments of the
      mouldering ruins, and leaning behind a broken wall which screened him from
      observation, he indulged himself in contemplating that noble but decayed
      edifice where so many of the happiest and most blameless hours of his life
      had been enjoyed. His first glance was directed towards the casement of
      Glorvina&rsquo;s room, but there nor in any other did the least glimmering of
      light appear. With a faultering step he advanced from his concealment
      towards the left wing of the castle, and snatched a hasty glance through
      the window of the banquetting hall. It was the hour in which the family
      were wont to assemble there. It was now impenetrably dark&mdash;he
      ventured to approach still closer, and fixed his eye to the glass; but
      nothing met the inquiry of his eager gaze save a piece of armour, on whose
      polished surface the moon&rsquo;s random beams faintly played. His heart was
      chilled; yet, encouraged by the silent desolation that surrounded him, he
      ventured forward. The gates of the castle were partly open; the hall was
      empty and dark&mdash;he paused and listened&mdash;all was silent as the
      grave. His heart sunk within him&mdash;he almost wished to behold some
      human form, to hear some human sound. On either side, the doors of two
      large apartments stood open: he looked into each; all was chill and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grown desperate by gloomy fears, he proceeded rapidly up the stone stairs
      which wound through the centre of the building. He paused; and, leaning
      over the balustrade, listened for a considerable time; but when the echo
      of his footsteps had died away, all was again still as death.
      Horror-struck, yet doubting the evidence of his senses, to find himself
      thus far advanced in the interior of the castle, he remained for some time
      motionless&mdash;a thousand melancholy suggestions struck on his soul.
      With an impulse almost frantic he rushed to the corridor. The doors of the
      several rooms on either side lay open, and he thought by the moon&rsquo;s
      doubtful light they seemed despoiled of their furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he stood rapt in horror and amazement he heard the sound of
      Glorvina&rsquo;s harp, born on the blast which sighed at intervals along the
      passage. At first he believed it was the illusion of his fancy disordered
      by the awful singularity of his peculiar situation; to satisfy at once his
      insupportable doubts he flew to that room where the harp of Glorvina
      always stood: like the rest it was unoccupied and dimly lit up by the moon
      beams. The harp of Glorvina, and the couch on which he had first sat by
      her, were the only articles it contained: the former was still breathing
      its wild melody when he entered, but he perceived the melancholy vibration
      was produced by the sea breeze (admitted by the open casement) which swept
      at intervals along its strings. Wholly overcome he fell on the couch&mdash;his
      heart seemed scarcely susceptible of pulsation&mdash;every nerve of his
      brain was strained almost to bursting&mdash;he gasped for breath. The gale
      of the ocean continued to sigh on the cords of the harp, and its plaintive
      tones went to his very soul, and roused those feelings so truly in unison
      with every sad impression. A few burning tears relieved him from an agony
      he was no longer able to endure; and he was now competent to draw some
      inference from the dreadful scene of desolation by which he was
      surrounded. The good old Prince was no more!&mdash;or his daughter was
      married! In either case it was probable the family had deserted the <i>ruins</i>
      of Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      While absorbed in this heart-rending meditation, he saw a faint light
      gleaming on the ceiling of the room, and heard a footstep approaching.
      Unable to move, he sat breathless with expectation. An ancient female
      tottering and feeble, with a lantern in her hand, entered; and having
      fastened down the window, was creeping slowly along and muttering to
      herself: when she perceived the pale and ghastly figure of the stranger,
      she shrieked, let fall the light, and endeavoured to hobble away. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      followed, and caught her by the arm: she redoubled her cries&mdash;it was
      with difficulty he could pacify her&mdash;while, as his heart fluttered on
      his lips, he could only say, &ldquo;The lady Glorvina!&mdash;the Prince!&mdash;speak!&mdash;where
      are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman had now recovered her light, and holding it up to the face
      of Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, she instantly recognized him; he had
      been a popular favourite with the poor followers of Inismore: she was
      among the number; and her joy at having her terrors thus terminated, was
      such as for an interval to preclude all hope of obtaining any answer from
      her. With some difficulty the distracted and impatient M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      at last learnt from a detail interrupted by all the audible testimonies of
      vulgar grief, that an execution had been laid upon the Prince&rsquo;s property,
      and another upon his person; that he had been carried away to jail out of
      a sick bed, accompanied by his daughter, Father John, and the old nurse;
      and that the whole party had set off in the old family coach, which the
      creditors had not thought worthy taking away, in the middle of the night,
      lest the country people should rise to rescue the Prince, which the
      officers who accompanied him apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was proceeding in her narrative, but her auditor heard no
      more; he flew from the castle, and, mounting his horse, set out for the
      town where the Prince was imprisoned. He reached it early next morning,
      and rode at once to the jail. He alighted and inquired for Mr. O&rsquo;Melville,
      commonly called Prince of Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailor, observing his wild and haggard appearance, kindly asked him
      into his own room and then informed him that the Prince had been released
      two days back; but that his weak state of health did not permit him to
      leave the jail till the preceding evening, when he had set off for
      Inismore. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the jailor, &ldquo;he will never reach his old castle
      alive, poor gentleman! which he suspected himself; for he received the
      last ceremonies of the church before he departed, thinking, I suppose,
      that he would die on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overcome by fatigue and a variety of overwhelming emotions, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      sunk motionless on a seat; while the humane jailor, shocked by the
      wretchedness of his looks, and supposing him to be a near relative,
      offered some words of consolation, and informed him there was then a
      female domestic of the Prince&rsquo;s in the prison, who was to follow the
      family in the course of the day, and who could probably give him every
      information he might require. This was welcome tidings to Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;;
      and he followed the jailor to the room where the Prince had been confined,
      and where the old nurse was engaged in packing up some articles, which
      fell out of her hands when she perceived her favourite and patient, whom
      she cordially embraced with the most passionate demonstrations of joy and
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailor retired; and Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, shuddering as
      he contemplated the close and gloomy little apartment, its sorry
      furniture, and grated windows, where the suffering Glorvina had been
      imprisoned with her father, briefly related to the nurse that, having
      learnt the misfortunes of the Prince, he had followed him to the prison,
      in the hope of being able to give him some assistance, if not to effect
      his liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was as usual garrulous and communicative; she wept
      alternately the Prince&rsquo;s sufferings and tears of joy for his release;
      talked sometimes of the generosity of the good friend, who had, she said,
      &ldquo;been the saviour of them all,&rdquo; and sometimes of the Christian fortitude
      of the Prince; but still dwelt most on the virtues and afflictions of her
      young lady, whom she frequently termed <i>a saint out of heaven</i>, a
      suffering-angel, and a martyr. She then related the circumstances of the
      Prince&rsquo;s imprisonment in terms so affecting, yet so simple, that her own
      tears dropt not faster than those of her auditor. She said that she
      believed they had looked for assistance from their concealed friend until
      the last moment, when the Prince, unable to struggle any longer, left his
      sick bed for the prison of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; that Glorvina had
      supported her father during their melancholy journey in her arms, without
      suffering even a tear, much less a complaint to escape her; that she had
      supported his spirits and her own as though she were more than human,
      until the physician who attended the Prince gave him over; that then her
      distraction (when out of the presence of her father) knew no bounds; and
      that once they feared her senses were touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at a moment when they were all reduced to despair, the mysterious
      friend arrived, paid the debt for which the Prince was confined, and had
      carried them off the evening before, by a more tedious but less rugged
      road than that she supposed Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had taken,
      by which means he had probably missed them. &ldquo;For all this, (continued the
      old woman weeping) my child will never be happy: she is sacrificing
      herself for her father, and he will not live to enjoy the benefit of it.
      The gentleman is indeed good and comely to look at; and his being old
      enough to be her father matters nothing; but then love is not to be
      commanded, though duty may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. M. struck by these words fell at her feet, conjured her not to conceal
      from him the state of her lady&rsquo;s affections, confessed his own secret
      passion, in terms as ardent as it was felt. His recent sufferings and
      suspicions, and the present distracted state of his mind, his tears, his
      entreaties, his wildly energetic supplications, his wretched but
      interesting appearance, and above all the adoration he professed for the
      object of her own tenderest affection, finally vanquished the small
      portion of prudence and reserve interwoven in the unguarded character of
      the simple and affectionate old Irish woman, and she at last confessed,
      that the day after his departure from the castle of Inismore, Glorvina was
      seized with a fever, in which, after the first day, she became delirious;
      that during the night, as the nurse sat by her, she awakened from a deep
      sleep and began to speak much of Mr. Mortimer, whom she called her <i>friend</i>,
      her <i>preceptor</i>, and her <i>lover</i>; talked wildly of her having
      been <i>united to him by God in the vale of Inismore</i>, and drew from
      her bosom a sprig of withered myrtle, which, she said, had been a bridal
      gift from her beloved, and that she often pressed it to her lips and
      smiled, and began to sing an air which, she said, was dear to him; until
      at last she burst into tears, and wept herself to sleep again. &ldquo;When she
      recovered,&rdquo; continued the nurse, &ldquo;which, owing to her youth and fine
      constitution, she did in a few days, I mentioned to her some of these
      sayings, at which she changed colour, and begged that as I valued her
      happiness I would bury all I had heard in my own breast; and above all bid
      me not mention your name, as it was now her duty to forget you; and last
      night I heard her consent to become the wife of the good gentleman; but
      poor child it is all one, for she will die of a broken heart. I see
      plainly she will not long survive her father, nor will ever love any but
      you!&rdquo; At these words the old woman burst into a passion of tears, while
      Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; catching her in his arms, exclaimed, &ldquo;I
      owe you my life, a thousand times more than my life;&rdquo; and throwing his
      purse into her lap, flew to the inn, where having obtained a hack horse,
      given his own in care to the master, and taken a little refreshment which
      his exhausted frame, long fasting, and extraordinary fatigue required, he
      again set out for the Lodge. His sole object was to obtain an interview
      with Glorvina, and on the result of that interview to form his future
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      To retrace the wild fluctuations of those powerful and poignant feelings
      which agitated a mind alternately the prey of its wishes and its fears,
      now governed by the impetuous impulses of unconquerable love, now by the
      sacred ties of filial affection, now sacrificing every consideration to
      the dictates of duty, and now forgetting everything in the fond dreams of
      passion, would be an endless, an impossible task; when still vibrating
      between the sweet felicities of new-born hope, and the gloomy suggestions
      of habitual doubt. The weary traveller reached the peninsula of In-ismore
      about the same hour that he had done the preceding day. At the drawbridge
      he was met by a peasant whom he had known and to whom he gave his horse.
      The man, with a countenance full of importance, was going to address him,
      but he sprung eagerly forward and was in a moment immersed in the ruins of
      the castle; intending to pass through the chapel as the speediest and most
      private way, and to make his arrival first known to Father John, to
      declare to the good priest his real name and rank, his passion for
      Glorvina, and to receive his destiny from her lips only.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely entered the chapel when the private door by which it
      communicated with the castle flew open. He screened himself behind a
      pillar, from whence he beheld Father John proceeding with a solemn air
      towards the altar, followed by the Prince, carried by three servants in an
      arm chair, and apparently in the last stage of mortal existence. Glorvina
      then appeared wrapt in a long veil and supported on the arm of a stranger,
      whose figure and air was lofty and noble, but whose face was concealed by
      the recumbent attitude of his head, which drooped towards that of his
      apparently feeble companion, as if in the act of addressing her. This
      singular procession advanced to the altar; the chair of the Prince re
      posed at his feet. The priest stood at the sacred table&mdash;Glorvina and
      her companion knelt at its steps. The last red beams of the evening sun
      shone through a stormy cloud on the votarists all was awfully silent; a
      pause solemn and affecting ensued; then the priest began to celebrate the
      marriage rites; but the first words had not died on his lips, when a
      figure, pale and ghastly, rushed forward, wildly exclaiming, &ldquo;Stop, I
      charge you, stop! you know not what you do! it is a sacrilege!&rdquo; and
      breathless and faint the seeming maniac sunk at the feet of the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      A convulsive shriek burst from the lips of Glorvina. She raised her eyes
      to heaven, then fixed them on her unfortunate lover, and dropped lifeless
      into his arms&mdash;a pause of indiscribable emotion succeeded. The
      Prince, aghast, gazed on the hapless pair; thus seemingly entwined in the
      embrace of death. The priest transfixed with pity and amazement let fall
      the sacred volume from his hands. Emotions of an indescribable nature
      mingled in the countenance of the bridegroom. The priest was the first to
      dissolve the spell, and to recover a comparative presence of mind; he
      descended from the altar and endeavoured to raise and extricate the
      lifeless Glorvina from the arms of her unhappy lover, but the effort was
      vain. Clasping her to his heart closer than ever, the almost frantic M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      exclaimed, &ldquo;She is mine! mine in the eye of heaven! and no human power can
      part us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful providence!&rdquo; exclaimed the bridegroom faintly, and sunk on the
      shoulders of the priest. The voice pierced to the heart of his rival; he
      raised his eyes, fell lifeless against the railing of the altar, faintly
      uttering, &ldquo;God of Omnipotence! my father!&rdquo; Glorvina released from the
      nerveless clasp of her lover, sunk on her knees between the father and the
      son, alternately fixed her wild regard on both, then suddenly turning them
      on the now apparently expiring Prince, she sprang forward, and throwing
      her arms round his neck, frantically cried, &ldquo;It is my father they will
      destroy and sobbing convulsively, sunk, overcome, on his shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince pressed her to his heart, and looking round with a ghastly and
      inquiring glance for the explanation of that mystery no one had the power
      to unravel, and by which all seemed overwhelmed. At last, with an effort
      of expiring strength, he raised himself in his seat, entwined his arm
      round his child, and intimated by his eloquent looks, that he wished the
      mysterious father and his rival son to approach. The priest led the former
      towards him: the latter sprang to his feet, and hid his head in his
      mantle: all the native dignity of his character now seemed to irradiate
      the countenance of the Prince of Inismore; his eyes sparkled with a
      transient beam of their former fire; and the retreating powers of life
      seemed for a moment to rush through his exhausted veins with all their
      pristine vigour. With a deep and hollow voice he said: &ldquo;I find I have been
      deceived, and my child, I fear, is to become the victim of this deception.
      Speak, mysterious strangers, who have taught me at once to <i>love</i> and
      to <i>fear</i> you&mdash;what, and who are you? and to what purpose have
      you mutually, but apparently unknown to each other, stolen on our
      seclusion, and thus combined to embitter my last hours, by threatening the
      destruction of my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long and solemn pause ensued, which was at last interrupted by the Earl
      of M. With a firm and collected air he replied: &ldquo;That youth who kneels at
      your feet, is my son; but till this moment I was ignorant that he was
      known to you: I was equally unaware of those claims which he has now made
      on the heart of your daughter. If he has deceived you he also, has
      deceived his father! For myself, if imposition can be extenuated, mine
      merits forgiveness, for it was founded on honourable and virtuous motives.
      To restore to you the blessings of independence; to raise your daughter to
      that rank in life, her birth, her virtues, and her talents merit; and to
      obtain your assistance in dissipating the ignorance, improving the state,
      and ameliorating the condition of those poor unhappy compatriots, who,
      living immediately within your own sphere of action, are influenced by
      your example, and would best be actuated by your counsel. Such were the
      wishes of my heart; but <i>prejudice</i>, the enemy of all human virtue
      and human felicity, forbade their execution. My first overtures of amity
      were treated with scorn; my first offers of service rejected with disdain;
      and my crime was that in a distant age an ancestor of mine, by the fortune
      of war, had possessed himself of those domains, which, in a more distant
      age, a remoter ancestor of yours won by similar means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus denied the open declaration of my good intents, I stooped to the
      assumption of a fictitious character; and he who as a hereditary enemy was
      forbid your house, as an unknown and unfortunate stranger, under affected
      circumstances of peculiar danger, was received to your protection, and
      soon to your heart as its dearest friend. The influence I obtained over
      your mind, I used to the salutary purpose of awakening it to a train of
      ideas more liberal than the prejudices of education had hitherto suffered
      it to cherish; and the services I had it in my power to render you, the
      fervour of your gratitude so far over-rated, as to induce you to repay
      them by the most precious of all donations&mdash;your child. But for the
      wonderful and most unexpected incident which has now crossed your designs,
      your daughter had been by this the wife of the Earl of M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a strong convulsion of expiring nature, the Prince started from his
      chair; gazed for a moment on the Earl with a fixed and eager look and
      again sunk on his seat; it was the last convulsive throe of life roused
      into existence by the last violent feeling of mortal emotion. With an
      indefinable expression, he directed his eyes alternately from the father
      to the son, then sunk back and closed them: the younger M. clasped his
      hand, and bathed it with tears; his daughter, who hung over him, gazed
      intently on his face, and though she tremblingly watched the extinction of
      that life in which her own was wrapped up, her air was wild, her eye
      beamless, her cheek pale; grief and amazement seemed to have bereft her of
      her senses, but her feelings had lost nothing of their poignancy: the Earl
      of M. leaned on the back of the Prince&rsquo;s chair, his face covered with his
      hand: the priest held his right hand, and wept like an infant: among the
      attendants there was not one appeared with a dry eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long and affecting pause, the Prince heaved a deep sigh, and
      raised his eyes to the crucifix which hung over the altar: the effusions
      of a departing and pious soul murmured on his lips, but the powers of
      utterance were gone; every mortal passion was fled, save that which
      flutters with the last pulse of life in the heart of a doating father,
      parental solicitude and parental love. Religion claimed his last sense of
      duty, nature his last impulse of feeling; he fixed his last gaze on the
      face of his daughter; he raised himself with a dying effort to receive her
      last kiss: she fell on his bosom, their arms interlaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this attitude he expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina, in the arms of the attendants, was conveyed lifeless to the
      castle. The body of the Prince was carried to the great hall, and there
      laid on a bier. The Earl of M. walked by the side of the body, and his
      almost lifeless son, supported by the arm of the priest (who himself stood
      in need of assistance,) slowly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder M. had loved the venerable Prince as a brother and a friend: the
      younger as a father. In their common regret for the object of their mutual
      affection, heightened by that sadly affecting scene they had just
      witnessed, they lost for an interval a sense of that extraordinary and
      delicate situation in which they now stood related towards each other;
      they hung on either side in a mournful silence over the deceased object of
      their friendly affliction; while the concourse of poor peasants, whom the
      return of the Prince brought in joyful emotion to the castle, now crowded
      into the hall, uttering those vehement exclamations of sorrow and
      amazement so consonant to the impassioned energy of their national
      character. To still the violence of their emotions, the priest kneeling at
      the foot of the bier began a prayer for the soul of the deceased. All who
      were present knelt around him: all was awful, solemn, and still. At that
      moment Glorvina appeared; she had rushed from the arms of her attendants;
      her strength was resistless, for it was the energy of madness; her senses
      were fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence ensued; for the emotion of the priest would not suffer him
      to proceed. Regardless of the prostrate throng, she glided up the hall to
      the bier, and gazing earnestly on her father, smiled sadly, and waved her
      hand; then kissing his cheek, she threw her veil over his face, and
      putting her finger on her lip, as if to impose silence, softly exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Hush! he does not suffer now! he sleeps! it was I who lulled him to
      repose with the song his heart loves!&rdquo; and then kneeling beside him, in a
      voice scarcely human, she breathed out a soul-rending air she had been
      accustomed to sing to her father from her earliest infancy. The silence of
      compassion, of horror, which breathed around, was alone interrupted by her
      song of grief, while no eye save hers was dry. Abruptly breaking off her
      plaintive strains, she drew the veil from her father&rsquo;s face, and suddenly
      averting her gaze from his livid features, it wandered from the Earl of M.
      to his son; while with a piercing shriek she exclaimed, &ldquo;Which of you
      murdered my father?&rdquo; then looking tenderly on the younger M. (whose eyes
      not less wild than her own had followed her every motion,) she softly
      added, &ldquo;It was not you, my love!&rdquo; and with a loud convulsive laugh she
      fell lifeless into the priest&rsquo;s arms, who was the first who had the
      presence of mind to think of removing the still lovely maniac. The rival
      father and his unhappy son withdrew at the same moment; and when the
      priest (having disposed of his unfortunate charge) returned to seek them,
      he found them both in the same apartment, but at a considerable distance
      from each other, both buried in silent emotion&mdash;both labouring under
      the violence of their respective feelings. The priest attempted some words
      expressive of consolation to the younger M. who seemed most the victim of
      uncontrollable affliction; but with a firm manner the earl interrupted
      him:&mdash;&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is no time for words; nature
      and feeling claim their prerogative, and are not to be denied. Your
      venerable friend is no more, but he has ceased to suffer: the afflicted
      and angelic being, whose affecting sorrows so recently wrung our hearts
      with agony, has still, I trust, many years of felicity and health in store
      to compensate for her early trials; from henceforth I shall consider her
      as the child of my adoption. For myself, the motives by which my
      apparently extraordinary conduct was governed were pure and disinterested;
      though the means by which I endeavoured to effect my laudable purpose were
      perhaps not strictly justifiable in the eye of rigid, undeviating
      integrity. For this young man!&rdquo; he paused, and fixing his eyes on his son
      till they filled with tears, the strongest emotions agitating his frame;
      Mr. M. rushed forward, and fell on his father&rsquo;s breast. The earl pressed
      him to his heart, and putting his hands in those of Father John, he said,
      &ldquo;To your care and tenderness I commend my child; and from you,&rdquo; he added,
      addressing his son, &ldquo;I shall expect the developement of that mystery,
      which is as yet dark and unfathomable. Remain here till we fully
      understand each other. I depart to night for M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house. It is reserved for you to assist this worthy man in the last solemn
      office of friendship and humanity. It is reserved for you to watch over
      and cherish that suffering angel, for whose future happiness we both
      mutually stand accountable.&rdquo; With these words Lord M. again embraced his
      almost lifeless son, and pressing the hand of the priest withdrew. Father
      John followed him; but importunities were fruitless; his horses were
      ordered, and having put a bank-note of considerable amount into his hands
      to defray the funeral expenses, he departed from Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of four days, the remains of the Prince were consigned to
      the tomb. Glorvina&rsquo;s health and fine constitution were already prevailing
      over her disorder and acute sensibility; her senses were gradually
      returning, and only appeared subject to wander when a sense of her recent
      suffering struck on her heart. The old nurse was the first who ventured to
      mention to her that her unhappy lover was in the house; but though she
      appeared struck and deeply affected by the intelligence, she never
      mentioned his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mr. M., owing to his recent sufferings of mind and body, was
      seized with a slow fever and confined for many days to his bed. A
      physician of eminence in the country had taken up his residence at
      Inismore, and a courier daily passed between the castle and M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      house, with his reports of the health of the two patients to the Earl. In
      a fortnight they were both so far recovered, as to remove from their
      respective bedrooms to an adjoining apartment. The benevolent priest, who
      day and night had watched over them, undertook to prepare Glorvina for the
      reception of Mr. M. whose life seemed to hang upon the restoration of
      hers. When she heard that he was still in the castle, and had just escaped
      from the jaws of death, she shuddered and changed colour; and with a faint
      voice inquired for his father. When she learnt he had left the castle on
      the night when she had last seen him, she seemed to feel much
      satisfaction, and said, &ldquo;What an extraordinary circumstance! What a
      mystery!&mdash;the father and the son!&rdquo; She paused, and a faint hectic
      coloured her pale cheek; then added, &ldquo;unfortunate and imprudent young man!
      Will his father forgive and receive him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dearer than ever to his father&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;the
      first use he made of his returning health, was to write to his inestimable
      parent, confessing without the least reservation every incident of his
      late extraordinary adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when does he leave the castle!&rdquo; inarticulately demanded Glorvina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That rests with you,&rdquo; replied the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned aside her head and sighed heavily then bursting into tears,
      flung her arms affectionately round her beloved preceptor, and cried, &ldquo;I
      have now no father but you&mdash;act for me as such.&rdquo; The priest pressed
      her to his heart, and, drawing a letter from his bosom, said, &ldquo;This is
      from one who pants to become your father in the strictest sense of the
      word; it is from Lord M., but though addressed to his son, it is equally
      intended for your perusal. That son, that friend, that lover, whose life
      and happiness now rests in your hands, in all the powerful emotions of
      hope, doubt, anxiety, and expectation, now waits to be admitted to your
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glorvina, gasping for breath, caught hold of the priest&rsquo;s arm, then sunk
      back upon her seat, and covered her face with her hands. The priest
      withdrew, and in a few minutes returned, leading in the agitated invalid;
      then placing the hands of the almost lifeless Glorvina in his, retired. He
      felt the mutual delicacy of their situation, and forbore to heighten it by
      his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours had elapsed before the venerable priest again sought the two
      objects dearest to his heart; he found Glorvina overwhelmed with soft
      emotion, her cheek covered with blushes, and her hand clasped in that of
      the interesting invalid, whose flushing colour and animated eyes spoke the
      return of health and happiness; not indeed confirmed, but fed by sanguine
      hope; such hope as the heart of a mourning child could give to the object
      of her heart&rsquo;s first passion, in that era of filial grief, when sorrow is
      mellowed by reason, and soothed by religion into a tender but not
      ungracious melancholy. The good priest embraced and blessed them
      alternately, then, seated between them, read aloud the letter of Lord M.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO THE HON. HORATIO M.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ince human
      happiness, like every other feeling of the human heart, loses its
      poignancy by reiteration, its fragrance with its bloom; let me not (while
      the first fallen dew of pleasure hangs fresh upon the flower of your
      existence) seize on those precious moments which <i>Hope</i>, rescued from
      the fangs of despondency, and bliss, succeeding to affliction, claim as
      their own. Brief be the detail which intrudes on the hour of newborn joy,
      and short the narrative which holds captive the attention, while the
      heart, involved in its own enjoyments, denies its interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now unnecessary for me fully to explain all the motives which led me
      to appear at the castle of Inismore in a fictitious character. Deeply
      interested for a people whose national character I had hitherto viewed
      through the false medium of prejudice; anxious to make it my study in a
      situation, and under circumstances, which as an English landholder, as the
      Earl of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, was denied me, and to turn the stream of
      my acquired information to that channel which would tend to the promotion
      of the happiness and welfare of those whose destiny, in some measure, was
      consigned to my guidance:&mdash;solicitous to triumph over the hereditary
      prejudices of my hereditary enemy; to seduce him into amity, and force him
      to <i>esteem</i> the man he <i>hated</i>; while he unconsciously became
      his accessary in promoting the welfare of those of his humble compatriots
      who dwelt within the sphere of our mutual observation. Such were the <i>motives</i>
      which principally guided my late apparently romantic adventure; would that
      the <i>means</i> had been equally laudable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Received into the mansion of the generous but incautious Prince, as a
      proscribed and unfortunate wanderer, I owed my reception to his humanity
      rather than his prudence; and when I told him that I threw my life into
      his power, his <i>honour</i> became bound for its security, though his
      principles condemned the conduct which he believed had effected its just
      forfeiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months, in two succeeding summers, I contrived to perpetuate,
      with plausive details, the mystery I had forged; and to confirm the
      interest I had been so fortunate at first to awaken into an ardent
      friendship, which became as reciprocal as it was disinterested. Yet it was
      still <i>my</i> destiny to be loved identically as myself; as myself
      adventitiously to be <i>hated</i>. And the name of the Earl of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      was forbidden to be mentioned in the presence of the Prince, while he
      frequently confessed that the happiest of his hours were passed in Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus singularly situated, I dared not hazard a revelation of my real
      character, lest I should lose by the discovery all those precious
      immunities with which my fictitious one had endowed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while it was my good fortune thus warmly to ingratiate myself with the
      father, can I pass over in silence my prouder triumph in that filial
      interest I awakened in the heart of his daughter. Her tender commiseration
      for my supposed misfortunes; the persevering goodness with which she
      endeavoured to rescue me from those erroneous principles she believed the
      efficient cause of sufferings, and which I appeared to sacrifice to her
      better reason. The flattering interest she took in my conversation; the
      eagerness with which she received those instructions it was my supreme
      pleasure to bestow on her; and the solicitude she incessantly expressed
      for my fancied doubtful fate; awakened my heart&rsquo;s tenderest regard and
      liveliest gratitude. But though I admired her genius and adored her
      virtues, the sentiment she inspired never for a moment lost its character
      of parental affection; and even when I formed the determination, the
      accomplishment of which you so unexpectedly, so providentially frustrated,
      the gratification of any selfish wish, the compliance with any passionate
      impulse, held no influence over the determination. No, it was only
      dictated by motives pure as the object that inspired them; it was the wish
      of snatching this lovely blossom from the desert where she bloomed unseen,
      of raising her to that circle in society her birth entitled her to, and
      her graces were calculated to adorn; of confirming my amity with her
      father by the tenderest unity of interests and affection; of giving her a
      legally sanctioned claim on that part of her hereditary property which the
      suspected villany of my steward had robbed her of; and of retributing the
      parent through the medium of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I had a son to offer her, I had not offered her myself; but my eldest
      was already engaged, and for the worldly welfare of my second an alliance
      at once brilliant and opulent was necessary; for, dazzled by his real or
      supposed talents, I viewed his future destiny through the medium of
      parental ambition, and thought only of those means by which he might
      become great, without considering the more important necessity of his
      becoming happy. Yet, well aware of the phlegmatic indifference of the one,
      and the romantic imprudence of the other, I denied them my confidence,
      until the final issue of the adventure would render its revelation
      necessary. Nor did I suspect the possibility of their learning it by any
      other means; for the one never visited Ireland, and the other, as the son
      of Lord M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, would find no admittance to the
      castle of Inismore.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a fixed determination succeeded to some months of wavering
      indecision, I wrote to Glorvina, with whom I had been in habits of
      epistolary correspondence, distantly touching on a subject I yet
      considered with timidity, and faintly demanding her sanction of my wishes
      before I unfolded them to her father, which I assured her I would not do
      until I could claim her openly in my own character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interim, however, I received a letter from her, written previous to
      her receipt of mine. It began thus:&mdash;&ldquo;In those happy moments of
      boundless confidence, when the pupil and the child hung upon the
      instructive accents of the friend and the father, you have often said to
      me, &lsquo;I am not altogether what I seem; I am not only <i>grateful</i>, but I
      possess a power stronger than words of convincing those to whom I owe so
      much of my gratitude; and should the hour of affliction ever reach <i>thee</i>,
      Glorvina, call on me as the friend who would fly from the remotest corner
      of the earth to serve, to <i>save</i> thee.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The hour of affliction is arrived&mdash;I call upon you!</i>&rdquo; She then
      described the disordered state of her father&rsquo;s affairs, and painted his
      sufferings with all the eloquence of filial sorrow, requesting my advice,
      and flatteringly lamenting the destiny which placed us at such a distance
      from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to add, that I determined to answer this letter in person,
      and I only waited to embrace my loved and long estranged son on my arrival
      in Ireland. When I set out for Inismore I found the castle deserted, and
      learned, (with indescribable emotions of pity and indignation,) that the
      Prince and his daughter were the inhabitants of a <i>prison</i>. I flew to
      this sad receptacle of suffering virtue, and effected the liberation of
      the Prince. There <i>was</i> a time when the haughty spirit of this proud
      chieftain would have revolted against the idea of owing a pecuniary
      obligation to any man: but those only who have laboured under a long and
      continued series of mental and bodily affliction, can tell how the mind&rsquo;s
      strength is to be subdued, the energies of pride softened, and the
      delicacy of refined feelings blunted, by the pressure of reiterated
      suffering, of harassing and incessant disappointment. While the surprise
      of the Prince equalled his emotion, he exclaimed in the vehemence of his
      gratitude&mdash;&ldquo;Teach me at least how to thank you, since to repay you is
      impossible.&rdquo; Glorvina was at that moment weeping on my shoulder, her hands
      were clasped in mine, and her humid eyes beamed on me all the grateful
      feelings of her warm and susceptible soul. I gazed on her for a moment,&mdash;she
      cast down her eyes, and I thought pressed my hand; thus encouraged I
      ventured to say to the Prince, &ldquo;You talk in exaggerated terms of the
      little service I have done you,&mdash;would indeed it had been sufficient
      to embolden me to make that request which now trembles on my lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused&mdash;the Prince eagerly replied, &ldquo;there is nothing you can ask I
      am not anxious and ready to comply with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Glorvina&mdash;she blushed and trembled. I felt I was
      understood, and I added, &ldquo;then give me a legal claim to become the
      protector of your daughter, and through her to restore you to that
      independence necessary for the repose of a proud and noble spirit. In a
      few days I shall openly appear to the world, with honour and with safety,
      in my own name and character. Take this letter, it is addressed to the
      Earl of M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, whom I solemnly swear is not more
      your enemy than mine, and who consequently cannot be biased by partiality:
      from him you shall learn who and what I am; and until that period I ask
      not to receive the hand of your inestimable daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince took the letter and tore it in a thousand pieces; exclaiming,
      &ldquo;I cannot indeed equal, but I will at least endeavour to imitate your
      generosity. You chose me as your protector in the hour of danger, when
      confidence was more hazardous to him who reposed than him who received it.
      You placed your life in my hands with no other bond for its security than
      my <i>honour!</i> In the season of my distress you flew to save me: you
      lavished your property for my release, not considering the improbability
      of its remuneration! Take my child; her esteem, her affections, have long
      been yours; let me die in peace, by seeing her united to a worthy man!&mdash;<i>that</i>
      I <i>know</i> you are; what else you may be I will only learn from <i>the
      lips of a son-in-law</i>. Confidence at least shall be repaid by
      confidence.&rdquo; At these words the always generous, always vehement and
      inconsiderate Prince rose from his pillow and placed the hand of his
      daughter in mine, confirming the gift with a tear of joy and a tender
      benediction. Glorvina bowed her head to receive it&mdash;her veil fell
      over her face&mdash;the index of her soul was concealed: how then could I
      know what passed there? She was silent&mdash;she was obedient&mdash;and I
      was&mdash;&mdash; deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, on his arrival at the castle of In-ismore, felt the hour of
      dissolution stealing fast on every principle of life. Sensible of his
      situation, his tenderness, his anxiety for his child survived every other
      feeling; nor would he suffer himself to be carried to his chamber until he
      had bestowed her on me from the altar. I knew not then what were the
      sentiments of Glorvina. Entwined in the arms of her doating, dying father,
      she seemed insensible to every emotion, to every thought but what his fate
      excited; but however gratified I might have been at the intentions of the
      Prince, I was decidedly averse to their prompt execution. I endeavoured to
      remonstrate: a <i>look</i> from the Prince silenced every objection: and&mdash;&mdash;.
      But here let me drop the veil of oblivion over the past: let me clear from
      the tablets of memory those records of extraordinary and recent
      circumstances to which my heart can never revert but with a pang vibrating
      on its tenderest nerve. It is, however, the true spirit of philosophy to
      draw from the evil which cannot be remedied all the good of which in its
      tendency it is yet susceptible; and since the views of my parental
      ambition are thus blasted in the bloom, let me at least make him happy
      whom it was once my only wish to render eminent: know then, my imprudent
      but still dear son, that the bride chosen for you by your father&rsquo;s policy
      has, by an elopement with a more ardent lover (who followed her hither,)
      left your hand as free as your heart towards her ever was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take then to thy bosom <i>her</i> whom heaven seems to have chosen as the
      intimate associate of thy soul, and whom national and hereditary prejudice
      would in vain withhold from thee. In this the dearest, most sacred, and
      most lasting of all human ties, let the names of Inismore and M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      be inseparably blended, and the distinctions of English and Irish, of
      Protestant and Catholic, for ever buried. And, while you look forward with
      hope to this family alliance being prophetically typical of a national
      unity of interests and affections between those who may be actually
      severed, but who are naturally allied, end your <i>own individual efforts</i>
      towards the consummation of an event so devoutly to be wished by every
      liberal mind, by every benevolent heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my life, I would have you consider those estates as yours, which I
      possess in this country; and at my death such as are not entailed. But
      this consideration is to be indulged conditionally, on your spending eight
      months out of every twelve on that spot from whence the very nutrition of
      your existence is to be derived; and in the bosom of those from whose
      labour and exertion your independence and prosperity are to flow. Act not
      with the vulgar policy of vulgar greatness, by endeavouring to exact
      respect through the medium of self-wrapt reserve, proudly shut up in its
      own self-invested grandeur; nor think it can derogate from the dignity of
      the <i>English landholder</i> openly to appear in the midst of his Irish
      peasantry, with an eye beaming complacency, and a countenance smiling
      confidence, and inspiring what it expresses. Show them you do not distrust
      them, and they will not betray you, give them reason to believe you feel
      an interest in their welfare, and they will endeavour to promote yours
      even at the risk of their lives; for the life of an Irishman weighs but
      light in the scale of consideration with his feelings; it is immolated
      without a murmur to the affections of his heart; it is sacrificed without
      a sigh to the suggestions of his honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that you are not placed by despotism over a band of slaves,
      creatures of the soil and as such to be considered; but by Providence,
      over a certain portion of men, who, in common with the rest of their
      nation, are the descendants of a brave, a free, and an enlightened people.
      Be more anxious to remove <i>causes</i> than to punish <i>effects</i>; for
      trust me that it is only to
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Scotch the snake&mdash;not kill it,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      to confine error, and to awaken vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be cautious how you condemn; be more cautious how you deride, but be ever
      watchful to moderate that ardent impetuosity which flows from the natural
      tone of the national character, which is the inseparable accompaniment of
      quick and acute feelings, which is the invariable concomitant of
      constitutional sensibility: and remember that the same ardour of
      disposition, the same vehemence of soul, which inflames their errors
      beyond the line of moderate failing, nurtures their better qualities
      beyond the growth of moderate excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the influence then of your own bounded circle, pursue those means
      of promoting the welfare of the individuals consigned to your care and
      protection, which lies within the scope of all those in whose hands the
      destinies of their less fortunate brethren are placed. Cherish by kindness
      into renovating life those national virtues, which though so often
      blighted in the full luxuriance of their vigorous blow by the fatality of
      circumstances, have still been ever found vital at the root, which only
      want the nutritive beam of encouragement, the genial glow of confiding
      affection, and the refreshing dew of tender commiseration, to restore them
      to their pristine bloom and vigour: place the standard of support within
      their sphere; and like the tender vine which has been suffered by neglect
      to waste its treasures on the sterile earth, you will behold them
      naturally turning and gratefully twining round the fostering stem, which
      rescues them from a cheerless and grovelling destiny: and when by justly
      and adequately rewarding the laborious exertions of that life devoted to
      your service, the source of their poverty shall be dried up, and the
      miseries that flowed from it shall be forgotten; when the warm hand of
      benevolence shall have wiped away the cold dew of despondency from their
      brow; when reiterated acts of tenderness and humanity shall have thawed
      the ice which chills the native flow of their ardent feelings; and when
      the light of instruction shall have dispelled the gloom of ignorance and
      prejudice from their neglected minds, and their lightened hearts shall
      again throb with the cheery pulse of national exility;&mdash;then, <i>then,
      and not till then</i>, will you behold the day-star of national virtue
      rising brightly over the horizon of their happy existence; while the
      felicity which has awakened to the touch of reason and humanity, shall
      return back to, and increase the source from which it originally flowed:
      as the elements, which in gradual progress brighten into flame, terminate
      in a liquid light, which, reverberating in sympathy to its former kindred,
      genially warms and gratefully cheers the whole order of universal nature.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
